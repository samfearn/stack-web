It is available for Moodle, ILIAS and as an integration through LTI. Why use STACK? Algebraic answers Students can answer algebraic expressions, like \\(x^2+y\\), and answers are graded based on mathematical properties. Separate validation and assessment Answers are validated before they are marked, so students are not penalised for poor programming skills. Specific feedback Students are given feedback that refers to their specific answer and mistake, as if marked by hand. Randomisation STACK can generate random questions so students are shown different variants of questions, and can repeat quizzes with new variants. Language support STACK is available in most European languages and many more, including Hebrew and Japanese. Open-source STACK is free to use and is developed by educators like yourself. Contributions are welcomed and encouraged. Learn more Get Started Who uses STACK? STACK is used by universities, commercial partners, developers and more, in over 15 countries. To read about the many ways STACK is used around the world, please visit our Case Studies page. Case Studies Training and Events We host regular training workshops and a yearly international STACK conference.

STACK helps students learn from their mistakes through specific feedback. Computer Algebra Support STACK uses the Computer Algebra System Maxima to evaluate expressions. Mathematical answers: questions are not limited to multiple choice. Randomise questions: so different students see different variants of a quiz. Graphical support: make your questions stand out by integrating Maxima plots, JSXGraphs or Google Charts. Validation of answers Before answers are graded, students confirm their answer is interpreted correctly by the system. Invalid answers, like ones with mismatched brackets, are rejected. Fair: students are not penalised for poor computer skills. Flexible: the teacher decides what a valid answer looks like. Intelligent marking Teachers write grading trees that mark answers based on mathematical properties, like \"is it factored?\" Specific feedback tailored to each student's answer. Multipart questions with follow-through marking. Give-example style questions with many correct answers. Diverse question types involving scientific units, numerical accuracy, line-by-line reasoning and more. Open-source As an open-source project, users help improve STACK by adding features, translations, bug reports and more. Many users share STACK materials, for example through the ABACUS material bank. Credits and contributions ABACUS material bank Commercial hosting We appreciate some people prefer hosted services as an alternative to running their own server.

Initially, the University was running a STACK version developed in-house specifically for the University, but this was later merged back into the main STACK branch in version 3.0. After receiving funding, the material bank Abacus was created, with the purpose of helping institutions collaborate and share STACK questions. The project's agreement was written in a way that ensured question authors kept their copyright, while still encouraging collaboration. Abacus has 30 members and its courses cover most of undergraduate mathematics and many parts of physics. Motivation The MatTa group (\"Matematiikkaa tietokoneavusteisesti\"; \"mathematics by using computers\") was founded in 1990s by lecturer Emeritus Simo K. Kivel\u00e4 at the Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis at Aalto University, formerly known as Helsinki University of Technology. The purpose of the group was to investigate the use of computers and information technology to teach engineering mathematics. Initially, the projects involved, for example, using visualisations, multimedia and symbolic computation to make mathematical content more interesting and accessible for students. The group also produced a number of free Finnish language electronic lecture notes with interactive content and a substantial database of traditional pen and paper exercise assignments called Euler. In 2006, the group started to take interest in automatic assessment, as they believed computer-aided methodologies could achieve a practical impact in teaching activities there. There was also hope at the University that Computer Aided Assessment could reduce the number of students assistants required to grade homework, both to save cost and because a sufficient number of qualified graders was not always available. Initially, the group focused on the Maple T.A. system, however it was found lacking in several aspects. The most important of these were performance issues and an incompatibility with various browsers, in particular ones available for the Linux operating system. The high licensing fees were also a problem, as they could undo all the savings that the University hoped to achieve by using the system. In spring of 2006, the group started gaining interest in STACK, which has an open source license. This license would allow the University to use its in-house software development skills to improve the platform where needed, and it would also guarantee that licence fees would not be imposed in the future. After deciding to use STACK, which was running its standalone version 1.x at the time, the group spent the summer of 2006 modifying the software to better suit the University's needs. This included replacing the rendering code of mathematical formulas to support browsers other than Microsoft Internet Explorer, translating the software to Finnish and a Shibboleth based integration with the Finnish national Haka single-sign-in system. Implementing STACK Figure: An interactive STACK question from Aalto University's \"Multivariable Calculus\" course, where students drag points along a contour line. After modifying the system, the University started testing STACK. The initial test was with the university's Basic Course in Engineering Mathematics KP3. A. Rasila wrote four STACK assignments for each week of the course, all of which were relatively simple questions involving numerical or algebraic input. The system had numerous small technical issues, but the students were generally happy with the system as evidenced both by student feedback and general usage statistics [1]. Encouraged by the positive results, it was decided to test the system more comprehensively to convince the teaching community that automatic assessment was worth of the effort in teaching engineering mathematics. It was important to show that the online assessment could be used by teachers with little programming skill, and that it would not cause a large increase in their workload. This was crucial for the long-term success of the project, as MatTa's previously developed materials were often only used by a handful of teachers, most of whom where developers themselves. Furthermore, the group needed to demonstrate that the system had real cost savings, as well as good learning outcomes compared to traditional types of assignments. The University set up an experimental course \"Discrete Mathematics\", where STACK would form a significant portion of the final grade [2]. Following the positive results of this course, the use of STACK began to spread at the University, and within three years, most basic courses in Engineering Mathematics at Aalto University were using STACK. STACK Developments A key ingredient in the success of STACK at Aalto University were the in-house developments by programmer Matti Harjula, also wrote his Master\u2019s Thesis on this work [3]. His initial work included analysing the data of the first 2006 experiment and further developing the system to address any shortcomings. His project was successful, as it led to a system that many lecturers at the department were willing to use, and no major issues were identified in the subsequent use of the system. However, it also led to a new problem. Independently from Aalto University, the British STACK developers had been developing STACK 2.0, which was very different from the 1.x series Aalto University had been using for their work. The in-house developments by Aalto University were not easily implemented into STACK 2.0, but merging the Aalto University code back into the trunk of STACK was still necessary for a number of reasons. Firstly, a unified code base would speed up the overall development of STACK, and the Department at Aalto University did not intend to permanently commit many resources to maintaining the system. Secondly, there was interest from other Finnish universities to try the system, however they preferred to use the \u201cofficial\u201d British version of STACK, which would prevent them from using the materials developed at Aalto University. Because of this, the Finnish and British developers agreed to join forces in combining their work into STACK 3.0. During the STACK 3.0 merge, experimental features of STACK were also being added to the Aalto University version, as documented in section 7.8 of [4]. These features were related to several pedagogical ideas, detailed in [5,6,7]. Creating Abacus There were two key advancements in 2015. Firstly, STACK 3.0 was completed and Aalto University had finalised their plans to the deploy the system as a replacement to their old in-house version. Since the University was now using the official STACK version, it was easier to collaborate with other Universities on STACK material. Secondly, the consortium of the seven Finnish technology universities called for proposals in developing collaborative practices in education. A draft proposal for joint development of electronic materials for mathematics education was proposed and selected as a pilot project with over half a million euros of funding. A. Rasila was chosen as the national coordinator of this project, which become known as the Abacus consortium [8]. Figure: The Abacus logo. Abacus is a database of teaching materials, mainly STACK questions, covering most basic topics in undergraduate mathematics. Its mission statement is to help lecturers find high quality and free learning materials, achieved through facilitating the sharing of online teaching resources between institutions. National and international collaboration is at the heart of the project, as it helps standardise the platform, minimise the necessary contribution of each institution and contribute to the overall market share of the platform. Language differences between courses is not a concern, since adding translations to individual questions are almost trivial compared to the expense of actually programming the mathematics e-content. In drafting the initial consortium agreement, Abacus drew from two other related projects, namely a 2009 e-learning collaboration project with the Bavarian Virtual University VHB, which was funded by the later discontinued Finnish Virtual University, and the MatTa material bank Euler. Fair Use In projects largely developed through public and institutional funding, fair use is a common problem. Some partners may feel they are contributing more than the rest, and hence will not be interested in collaboration and instead push for in-house development. Furthermore, collaborators who develop materials without being paid are often unhappy when someone else makes even minor monetary gains from their work, which has led to a widespread use of non-commercial licenses for academic work. While understandable, these restrictions hinder the acceptance of platforms like Abacus, and lead to divisions in the community. Furthermore, non-commercial licenses can be confusing, as the exact nature of commercial activity is not clearly defined in academia. For example, is \"free\" work done by a salaried lecturer commercial use? Finally, it can be necessary for institutions to share the sources of assignments due to international differences in notation, course content and language. On the other hand, a pure open source model is not particularly attractive for e-assessment materials, since students should not be able to search online for the teachers' answers. To solve these problems, the Abacus consortium agreement was written such that there are no strict legal restrictions on what kind of institutions can join the consortium or what kinds of materials can be included. The materials are shared in a way such that each partner gets substantial rights to develop them based on a license similar to open source, but is not allowed to share the source code with third parties. The original developers retain their copyright of the materials and are allowed to give them other licenses besides the one required by Abacus. Since new members are reviewed by the consortium's steering group and are required to make a one-time contribution to the consortium, the agreement encourages collaboration and guarantees that existing partners benefit from the growth of the consortium. Outlook As of July 2019, the Abacus consortium consists of 30 members, 17 of which are from Finland, as well as three from Estonia and two from both Germany and Norway. Other countries present in the consortium are China, France, Ireland, Portugal, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. There are ongoing discussions with several other potential partners, mainly from Europe. The database currently contains problem assignments for most bachelor level courses in mathematics, as well as a substantial number of physics assignments. Although Abacus accepts contributions in any language, most materials are available in English. Translations of the remaining Finnish-only materials are ongoing, and are expected to be completed in 2020. References [1] A. Rasila, M. Harjula, and K. Zenger.

STACK at Scale: The Open University Promoting STACK Across Disciplines at Loughborough University","title":"References"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/Adaptive/","text":"Overview Adaptive Self-learning Exercises Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum Michael Kallweit Abstract At the Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, students from all disciplines are offered digital mathematics tasks in an e-learning course for self-study in order to prepare and revise. These questions make intensive use of the randomisation and differentiated feedback options of the STACK question type. Some tasks have been supplemented by adaptive exercises, which guide the students through complex tasks. These adaptive tasks have had great success, are shown to have the same level of student engagement as paper-based tasks and be a better predictor of exam performance. Introduction At the Ruhr University Bochum, digital exercises have been used in courses at the Faculty of Mathematics since 2011, and since 2013 this has included STACK. In 2015, a cross-curricular e-learning course was set up, in which students can repeat and process selected topics for exam preparation by themselves. The course takes advantages of Moodle's gamification features: students gain points for engaging with quizzes, contributing to a \"level\". They also earn badges for completing material in a short time or with a high mark. Additionally, students have access to digital tutorial support. In addition to these features, the University wanted to add learning exercises that adapt to students' needs. Motivation In online assessment, weekly digital exercises are often done in \"examination mode\", that is, where students complete tasks in a given timeframe without interacting with the teachers in the meantime. Normally students are only allowed one attempt at the question, and differentiated feedback is only available for the students after the deadline. However, experience shows that students rarely use the detailed written feedback provided and are satisfied with just seeing their score. This observation is consistent with the students' responses to manually graded paper-based homework. Additionally, often valuable reflective loops that promote learning are omitted. As highlighted by Hattie's meta-analysis [2 and 3], it is important to increase students' interactivity with the feedback on their solutions. According to [4], good feedback should show concrete possibilities of how gaps in skills can be closed by students. Contrast this with tutorial lessons, where teachers often help students find a solution path. In the form of minimal assistance, teachers will intervene to help students achieve steady progress in dealing with a problem. If the students take an erroneous path to a solution, the teacher not just corrects the error, but will instead take the student on the path through the task. After being steered on the right path, the student will often fix the error by themselves. This procedure is known as instructional scaffolding: with just minimal support from the teacher, the students can master the individual tasks themselves, and can actively reflect on difficulties and mistakes during the process to close gaps in their knowledge. The developers at Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum wanted to bring this concept to online assessment: to build an online assessment system that can carry out instructional scaffolding to help students find a solution path. STACK was ideal for this, as its features in providing specific feedback depending on the properties of students answers provide a great foundation for an adaptive system. Adaptive self-learning approach Instead of being confronted by a teacher in a tutorial group, students can process adaptive digital self-learning tasks. Following the above principles, students follow an adaptive path of intermediate step tasks in small steps after submitting an incorrectly answered task. The intermediate steps focus on concrete knowledge and skills that must be combined to solve the original task. The adaptive methods were tested in entrance exams at secondary level II schools, through diagnostic error analysis tools [5,6,7]. The goal of this was to isolate the underlying errors behind why students incorrectly process digital tasks. Using digital tasks with STACK and a complex composition of digital tasks, the researchers achieved a considerable error detection rate of about 90%. Development of adaptive self-learning tasks Adaptive self-learning tasks follow the scaffolding principle. The error analysis and subsequent presentation of intermediate steps take place within the potential response trees of a STACK question, and offer added value compared to traditional digital tasks: In contrast to tasks in \"examination mode\", students actively deal with difficulties and errors. These are independently overcome by support in small steps and aim at a lasting learning success and increased motivation. Even with randomized STACK tasks, intermediate exercises refer to the task set at the beginning. A reference to the initial problem remains visible along the entire learning path. There are no limits on the design and variety of adaptive paths through the task. With each intermediate step, the next step can be selected on the basis of the student's individual input. The individual paths through the task are included in the source code of the individual STACK task, which allows questions to be easily shared between courses. The STACK Response Analysis Tool gives teachers insight into the paths taken by students. Technical implementation Moodle currently only offers limited possibilities for adaptively designing a sequence of tasks in tests. Hence, the adaptive tasks were introduced at the level of individual STACK questions. For each question, the potential response tree analyses the student's solution, and if they have made an error, shows a link to the starting point of an individual path. By including an externally stored Javascript file, the next intermediate step exercise becomes visible only by clicking on a button. The analysis of the input for this intermediate step is also stored in a response tree which adaptively defines the subsequent tasks. By repeating steps and integrating additional ones, the adaptive procedure can simulate real tutorial support. Example The following elementary example for matrix multiplication illustrates the central principles of the adaptive task format: Figure: An adaptable question about matrix multiplication. If the input of the solution is incorrect, the student is informed that they can work on the task again in guided intermediate steps via the \"Weiter\" (\"Next\") button. Figure: In the feedback, students may be told to work through the problem again, step-by-step. The first intermediate step then opens directly below the actual task, in this case asking students to identify the rule that is used when calculating matrix products. Subsequent steps will be available each time a step is correctly completed and the student clicks \"Next\" Figure: The three intermediate problem-solving steps for this question about matrix multiplication. The entire adaptive path with all intermediate step tasks has the following structure. Figure: An overview of the adaptive path for the matrix multiplication question. It is also possible to ask students to make a decision about which direction they want to take. Branches at which students make decisions about which direction they want to take are also possible. Overall, the feedback can be structured in a variety of ways according to Zech's hierarchy levels, with a focus on motivation, strategy or content help [8]. Results When comparing the University's new online assessment to their old, multiple-choice based system, several improvements become apparent. In multiple choice questions, you can only have a finite number of \"distractors\", but in STACK you can give feedback on an unlimited number of answers. In particular, the developers compared a question about expanding (2x+3y)^2, and found that while the old system had only 9 distractor options, the STACK system had registered 41 different answers over its lifetime, which could be grouped into 28 different types of mistakes. This is a major improvement on the number of mistakes students can receive specific feedback about. Additionally, the developers wanted to compare the performance of paper-based and digital homework. Across all courses, they did not find any significant difference in how many tasks students complete between the two systems. This is encouraging; the University saves resources by not relying on human markers for homework, and this confirms that they have not lost any functionality or student engagement by moving towards online assessment. For the course \"Mathematics for Chemistry\", the correlation between paper-based homework scores and exam scores was found to be 0.56, but the correlation between online homework scores and exam scores was 0.63. Similar results were found for the other courses at the University. Hence, online quiz scores are a better predictor for exam scores. Figure: Comparing both paper-based and online homework scores with exam scores, for the course \"Mathematics for Chemistry\". Challenges One of the main challenges of STACK integration was keeping up with new versions. It was important to convince administrators that going through the trouble of updating STACK was worth it, as new updates and features could be important to question authors. Additionally, there was a challenge in distributing the questions to new users, since Moodle's options for managing and distributing questions were found lacking. To solve this, a database for managing STACK questions in moodleXML files was created, which included more sophisticated search options. For each question, the system generates an overview pdf file with a short description, information on available languages, screenshots and an automatically generated overview of the potential response trees. About 700 questions are in the database, and because of its usability, it is easy to convince new users that it is simple to find good STACK questions. Enablers It was helpful to have a strong community of STACK users to help with projects. For example, one of the lecturers held a seminar to teach effective STACK usage to students training to become school teachers. The students of this class became a valuable community of STACK users willing to help with other projects. Additionally, it was valuable that STACK had been translated to German, as this allowed the University to easily spread STACK to other German institutions and build good partners. What's Next?

These adaptive tasks have had great success, are shown to have the same level of student engagement as paper-based tasks and be a better predictor of exam performance.","title":"Abstract"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/Adaptive/#introduction","text":"At the Ruhr University Bochum, digital exercises have been used in courses at the Faculty of Mathematics since 2011, and since 2013 this has included STACK. In 2015, a cross-curricular e-learning course was set up, in which students can repeat and process selected topics for exam preparation by themselves. The course takes advantages of Moodle's gamification features: students gain points for engaging with quizzes, contributing to a \"level\". They also earn badges for completing material in a short time or with a high mark. Additionally, students have access to digital tutorial support. In addition to these features, the University wanted to add learning exercises that adapt to students' needs.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/Adaptive/#motivation","text":"In online assessment, weekly digital exercises are often done in \"examination mode\", that is, where students complete tasks in a given timeframe without interacting with the teachers in the meantime. Normally students are only allowed one attempt at the question, and differentiated feedback is only available for the students after the deadline. However, experience shows that students rarely use the detailed written feedback provided and are satisfied with just seeing their score. This observation is consistent with the students' responses to manually graded paper-based homework. Additionally, often valuable reflective loops that promote learning are omitted. As highlighted by Hattie's meta-analysis [2 and 3], it is important to increase students' interactivity with the feedback on their solutions. According to [4], good feedback should show concrete possibilities of how gaps in skills can be closed by students. Contrast this with tutorial lessons, where teachers often help students find a solution path. In the form of minimal assistance, teachers will intervene to help students achieve steady progress in dealing with a problem. If the students take an erroneous path to a solution, the teacher not just corrects the error, but will instead take the student on the path through the task. After being steered on the right path, the student will often fix the error by themselves. This procedure is known as instructional scaffolding: with just minimal support from the teacher, the students can master the individual tasks themselves, and can actively reflect on difficulties and mistakes during the process to close gaps in their knowledge. The developers at Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum wanted to bring this concept to online assessment: to build an online assessment system that can carry out instructional scaffolding to help students find a solution path. STACK was ideal for this, as its features in providing specific feedback depending on the properties of students answers provide a great foundation for an adaptive system.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/Adaptive/#adaptive-self-learning-approach","text":"Instead of being confronted by a teacher in a tutorial group, students can process adaptive digital self-learning tasks. Following the above principles, students follow an adaptive path of intermediate step tasks in small steps after submitting an incorrectly answered task. The intermediate steps focus on concrete knowledge and skills that must be combined to solve the original task. The adaptive methods were tested in entrance exams at secondary level II schools, through diagnostic error analysis tools [5,6,7]. The goal of this was to isolate the underlying errors behind why students incorrectly process digital tasks. Using digital tasks with STACK and a complex composition of digital tasks, the researchers achieved a considerable error detection rate of about 90%.","title":"Adaptive self-learning approach"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/Adaptive/#development-of-adaptive-self-learning-tasks","text":"Adaptive self-learning tasks follow the scaffolding principle. The error analysis and subsequent presentation of intermediate steps take place within the potential response trees of a STACK question, and offer added value compared to traditional digital tasks: In contrast to tasks in \"examination mode\", students actively deal with difficulties and errors. These are independently overcome by support in small steps and aim at a lasting learning success and increased motivation. Even with randomized STACK tasks, intermediate exercises refer to the task set at the beginning. A reference to the initial problem remains visible along the entire learning path. There are no limits on the design and variety of adaptive paths through the task. With each intermediate step, the next step can be selected on the basis of the student's individual input. The individual paths through the task are included in the source code of the individual STACK task, which allows questions to be easily shared between courses. The STACK Response Analysis Tool gives teachers insight into the paths taken by students.","title":"Development of adaptive self-learning tasks"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/Adaptive/#technical-implementation","text":"Moodle currently only offers limited possibilities for adaptively designing a sequence of tasks in tests. Hence, the adaptive tasks were introduced at the level of individual STACK questions. For each question, the potential response tree analyses the student's solution, and if they have made an error, shows a link to the starting point of an individual path. By including an externally stored Javascript file, the next intermediate step exercise becomes visible only by clicking on a button. The analysis of the input for this intermediate step is also stored in a response tree which adaptively defines the subsequent tasks. By repeating steps and integrating additional ones, the adaptive procedure can simulate real tutorial support.","title":"Technical implementation"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/Adaptive/#example","text":"The following elementary example for matrix multiplication illustrates the central principles of the adaptive task format: Figure: An adaptable question about matrix multiplication.

Figure: In the feedback, students may be told to work through the problem again, step-by-step. The first intermediate step then opens directly below the actual task, in this case asking students to identify the rule that is used when calculating matrix products.

It is also possible to ask students to make a decision about which direction they want to take. Branches at which students make decisions about which direction they want to take are also possible.

In multiple choice questions, you can only have a finite number of \"distractors\", but in STACK you can give feedback on an unlimited number of answers. In particular, the developers compared a question about expanding (2x+3y)^2, and found that while the old system had only 9 distractor options, the STACK system had registered 41 different answers over its lifetime, which could be grouped into 28 different types of mistakes. This is a major improvement on the number of mistakes students can receive specific feedback about. Additionally, the developers wanted to compare the performance of paper-based and digital homework. Across all courses, they did not find any significant difference in how many tasks students complete between the two systems. This is encouraging; the University saves resources by not relying on human markers for homework, and this confirms that they have not lost any functionality or student engagement by moving towards online assessment. For the course \"Mathematics for Chemistry\", the correlation between paper-based homework scores and exam scores was found to be 0.56, but the correlation between online homework scores and exam scores was 0.63. Similar results were found for the other courses at the University. Hence, online quiz scores are a better predictor for exam scores.

To solve this, a database for managing STACK questions in moodleXML files was created, which included more sophisticated search options. For each question, the system generates an overview pdf file with a short description, information on available languages, screenshots and an automatically generated overview of the potential response trees.

A dedicated learning-technologist post was created to help course organisers implement online assessment. Replacing the current online assessment with human marking is currently estimated to save the School over 6100 hours of work marking students' work each year. Motivation The School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh had, over the years, grown to use a number of separate online assessment systems. However, there was growing concern that using separate systems created a number of problems, for example students had to learn the syntax of many different systems. It was also problematic that students needed to purchase access to the online systems provided by publishers. At the same time, student numbers in the UK continued to grow [1], and there were growing expectations from students for more frequent formative assessment in their courses. This motivated the school to bring all assessments in-house with STACK. Execution Figure: A typical Introduction to Linear Algebra question. STACK was first used in Edinburgh at a small scale for the Lothian Equal Access Programme for Schools (LEAPS) summer school in 2016. Following the success with LEAPS, STACK was used in larger courses such as Introduction to Linear Algebra, a year one module with over 600 students, in the 2016-17 academic year. The University's primary learning environment is Blackboard \"LEARN\", so students gain access to a dedicated STACK service via the LTI protocol through their normal LEARN pages. Having identified the need for additional support, the School of Mathematics created a dedicated \"Learning Technologist\" post. The primary goal of this post was to transform existing (largely paper-based) problem sets into online assessments and to develop alternatives to existing external online assessments. The Technologist used the following process to transform these assessments. Before the year started, current forms of assessment were reviewed, and suitable STACK questions were written together with course organisers. During the academic year, quizzes were made available, and their usage monitored. When the year was over, this monitoring data was analysed and questions were updated where appropriate. Creating online assessments is significant additional work, but once the quizzes have been created they require minimal work to maintain and can last for the lifetime of the course. Because of this cost-benefit relationship, employing a Learning Technologist has been an effective strategy in ensuring change actually took place. Results In 2019, many courses have online assessments using STACK. A course will typically have weekly or fortnightly assessment, many using a combination of flipped classroom \"reading quizzes\" (RQ), formative \"practice quizzes\" (PQ) and summative \"assessed quizzes\" (AQ). Some courses also make an optional mock online exam available to students. The following table provides an overview from the 18/19 year, including the number of students, how often quizzes were given out (per week W or semester S), the average number of questions per quiz (#Q/quiz) and the total number of questions (#Qs).

Cost Over the course of this project, the Learning Technologist estimates that developing a fully functioning quiz of 8 questions took about two person-days, or 16 hours of work, to create. As an example, consider the large first-year course \"Introduction to Linear Algebra\", with around 600 students in 65 tutorial groups. Replacing half of the weekly hand-ins with online assessments has saved each tutor over one hour of marking per week. Hence, over 65 hours of work is saved each week as a result. In addition, the students now complete more than double the number of practice problems, providing them with enhanced formative feedback which would be impossible to resource otherwise. Since online quizzes can be reused each year, this will be a consistent saving for as long as the course remains. Overall, it is estimated that STACK saves the University over 6100 hours of work each year [2]. Figure: Many School of Mathematics courses are taken at the James Clerk Maxwell Building. Barriers The goal was to have the first 4-6 weeks of quizzes ready before the beginning of a semester. However, as the term progressed, it was not unusual for the last few quizzes to be ready only \"at the last moment\". This did not give the question authors a lot of time to review their questions, but does reflect the realities of teaching. It was also important that the course organiser were fully involved in the authoring process. They had to give clear and explicit guidance on the learning objectives and help review the mathematical content. Finally, when working with large question banks, organising became difficult. Large Moodle question banks are tricky to browse, and maintenance becomes tedious when questions are duplicated between similar courses. Enablers The most significant factor in the success of this project was the dedicated Learning Technologist post. This was essential, as it assured course organisers had practical support, and that online quizzes could have a consistently high level of quality. It was helpful to be able to work closely with STACK developers when designing quizzes, in a way that is difficult with non-open-source programs. For example, the \"numerical\" input type which helps students enter answers at a pre-specified level of numerical accuracy, was designed to help cope with the difficulties of assessing vague student answers in statistics questions [3]. What's Next? The School of Mathematics continues to expand the use STACK at the University of Edinburgh. Future challenges involve modifying STACK to suit more conceptual courses, such as group theory and real analysis, as well as expanding into statistics and computer programming using the CodeRunner system [4]. There are also plans for wider use of STACK in summative assessments, with the possibility of using it in online examinations. References [1] Patterns and trends in UK higher education 2018.

Promoting STACK Across Disciplines at Loughborough University Diagnostics Testing With STACK","title":"References"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/FAC/","text":"Overview Developing a Fully Online Course The University of Edinburgh, UK Interview with George Kinnear and Richard Gratwick Abstract STACK is used in the completely online course \"Fundamentals of Algebra and Calculus\". The course is designed to prepare students for Higher Education (HE) study at the University of Edinburgh, where incoming students have a wide range of mathematical backgrounds. The main barriers were the risk of students using online answer engines to answer questions, and the lack of community. The organizers attempted to address this by clever question design and creating \"autonomous learning groups\". The course was enabled by University support, both in the form of a dedicated learning-technologist post and assistance from colleagues. Subsequent diagnostics test results indicate this course was successful. Introduction Approximately six hundred students typically study first-year mathematics courses at the University of Edinburgh. They have a wide range of mathematical backgrounds and attainments. \"Fundamentals of Algebra and Calculus\" (FAC) was introduced as an additional course, approximately covering SQA Advanced Higher Mathematics and A-Level Further Mathematics, to address the needs of this diverse group. Since some incoming students do not have the chance to take these higher qualifications before coming to university, the course fulfils a role as part of the University\u2019s Widening Participation strategy, enabling access to mathematics courses for a wider range of students, e.g. students admitted through contextual admissions. This also was an attempt to address a concern from the University that one reason for undergraduate non-continuation was a lack of preparation for the mathematical components of students\u2019 degree programmes, particularly those students on non-mathematics degrees within the College of Science and Engineering. Increasingly, the second-semester year 1 \"Calculus and its Applications\" course had been adapted to address these problems. However, staff and students felt that it recently contained too much material. FAC aimed to relieve some of the pressure on this course. FAC was delivered as a completely online course to make it scalable, since the above issues are not unique to the School or the University. FAC plays a role in addressing the so-called \u201cmathematics gap\u201d of attainment, preparing students from a wide range of mathematical backgrounds for HE study, and as such could easily see demand both across the University and beyond. Why Use STACK? FAC is essentially a course in mathematical techniques, assessing routine computation. STACK precisely lets teachers assess such questions automatically and give tailored feedback to students. Quite sophisticated questions can be implemented, for example \u201cgive an example\u201d type questions, asking students to provide examples of e.g. a quadratic with given roots, or a sequence with certain monotonicity or boundedness properties. These are important for \"retrieval practice\", that is, encouraging students to recall previous topics. Execution The course is worth 10 ECTS credits, and consists of approximately 200 hours of work for the student. The course is delivered in ten weekly units, each comprising a number of quizzes intended for students to work through during that week. Each week ends with a 90-minute \"Practice Quiz\" the student can take an unlimited number of times, and a 90-minute \"Final Test\" only allowing one attempt. The test is either given a grade of fail (0-80%), mastery (80-95%) or distinction (95%-100%). The high pass mark encourages students to master a topic before moving on. The final grade is determined by combining the results of the 10 \"Final Tests\" (worth 80%) with a final 2-hour test covering the whole course (worth 20%). The development involved a substantial up-front time investment: writing the material in these quizzes, including over 900 STACK questions. Although some existing questions were borrowed from other courses, the majority of these questions were authored from scratch. The quizzes interleave textbook-style exposition with videos of worked examples, interactive applets and practice questions, and as a result, the questions have a polished and varied look. Two lecturers were involved, each responsible for five units, with final cross-checking and occasional extra contributions. Research Figure: A FAC question aimed at both retrieval practice and building a strong example space. The design of the course was heavily influenced by educational research. Firstly, the course uses \"faded worked examples\", that is, presenting a sequence of problems with different amounts of the solution already worked out. For example, a topic might begin with a full worked solution of a problem, followed by a worked solution with the final step as a STACK input, followed by a worked solution with the last two steps as STACK input, and so on. There is evidence that this is helpful for students [2]. Additionally, given the literature on the importance of \"retrieval practice\" [3], FAC gives plenty of chances for students to recall what they have learned, for example by having quizzes draw on skills from previous weeks. Weeks alternate between algebra and calculus, spacing out practice of the two topics. Furthermore, the lecturers decided not to make feedback for the final tests available to students until after the deadline, since there is evidence suggesting delaying feedback is helpful for learning [5]. Finally, FAC gives students a chance to create strong \"example spaces\" [4], that is, sets of examples that a student can recall for a given topic. Example spaces are developed through \"give-an-example\" style questions, which are easy to write in STACK. Visuals FAC uses a lot of graphs and interactive applets to make questions visually appealing. Visual intuition is an important part of learning about functions, so it is appropriate for graphical components to play a significant part in this course. FAC uses both JSX graphs (which can be coded directly in STACK) and external plugins, like GeoGebra. The advantage of JSX graphs is that they are self-contained; there is no need to worry about changes to external programs, or licensing rights. There is, however, a large cost-benefit analysis to consider. JSX graphs are time-consuming and have a steep learning curve, while external applets are often quick to set up and have simple drag-and-drop features. Figure: FAC uses graphs and other visuals to aid learning. Results The six hundred students taking the first-semester year 1 \"Introduction to Linear Algebra\" course sat a diagnostic test (also delivered through STACK) in September 2018. In January 2019, the students sat the test again with the same questions but different random variants. In the September test, students also enrolled on FAC scored on average fifteen percentage points lower than their peers. This is not surprising; FAC will have been recommended to students who felt like they needed more practice in mathematics fundamentals. However, in January after studying FAC, they had gained these fifteen percentage points and were scoring in line with their peers. This is quantitative evidence that FAC has done exactly what was hoped: removed the discrepancy in attainment between the two groups of students. The lecturers also wanted to know if taking FAC had improved student performance in other maths courses such as \"Introduction to Linear Algebra\" (ILA) and \"Calculus and its Applications\" (CAP). Of students scoring similarly in the September diagnostics test, students who took FAC were scoring better than their peers in online quizzes for CAP. They also scored at a similar level to students who did not take FAC in the exams for ILA and CAP. Figure: Diagnostic results in September (pre) and January (post). Challenges While it is true that authoring a simple STACK question is ultimately straightforward, there was nonetheless a technological hurdle to be cleared. One lecturer was entirely new not only to STACK, but to Maxima and any form of online assessment, and therefore was confronted with quite an intimidating prospect. However, they ended up authoring hundreds of questions without trouble, and are now confident in undertaking significantly more demanding questions. This hurdle was easier to overcome given STACK requires no programming expertise. The lecturers were mindful of the possibility that students could be working through assessed quizzes in one browser tab, with a tool like WolframAlpha open in another. While ultimately this does no benefit to the student, and it remains their responsibility to ensure submitted answers are their own work, the potential of this kind of abuse should be minimised. This just required a bit of cunning at the level of question-setting: turning \u201cfind the derivative of this given function at this given point\u201d into \u201cat what point is the value of the derivative of this given function this given number?\u201d The limitations of an online course include the difficulties of forming meaningful staff-student and student-student interaction. The lack of real staff-student interaction made it hard to gauge whether the level and volume of material was suitable \u2013 anecdotal feedback indicates this was misjudged in at least one of the weekly units. Student-student interaction is important to foster a sense of community. This was addressed by setting up \u201cautonomous learning groups\u201d in which the students could study, in person, once a week, without staff input. Furthermore, students could ask questions in the online forum Piazza, and get in-person help in the MathsBase study room if needed. Enablers The University had created a dedicated learning-technologist post to help design the online assessment and write STACK questions. Their work was invaluable for authoring some of the questions, often given only a one-line sketch of the desired question. The capacity in STACK to clone questions and export questions from other courses was also very useful, making it possible to produce multiple related questions, sharing, for example, a grading structure, without duplicating any work. Finally, it was an advantage that there is substantial \u201cin-house\u201d support at the University, since STACK is now used across the entire first-year curriculum and increasingly beyond. Hence, there are a number of members of staff with experience of authoring questions, and the students are familiar with it. What's Next? A lot of data has been collected in FAC's first year. Quiz responses will be analysed to determine if any questions should be modified. There are also plans to have interviews with students on the effectiveness of the course, which will help identify areas that need work. The course organiser will be looking at improving the \"autonomous learning groups\". Since groups were given weekly tasks and asked to upload solutions to a shared Dropbox, the lecturers can see how much students interacted with these groups. Initially, the engagement was very strong, but half-way through the course, a lot of groups seemed to stop meeting. The course organiser will look at ways to improve turnout for these groups. The course continues to be worked on. The lecturers are considering options for more interactive questions, for example using equivalence reasoning to assess line-by-line arguments, or interactive JSX graphs that ask a student to, for example, \"drag a vector so it is perpendicular to another vector\". The success of FAC paves the way for similar methods to be used in different courses. Other schools have shown interest in creating similar online courses, and some students may find it helpful to have an online course teaching even less advanced maths. References [1] George Kinnear.

They have a wide range of mathematical backgrounds and attainments. \"Fundamentals of Algebra and Calculus\" (FAC) was introduced as an additional course, approximately covering SQA Advanced Higher Mathematics and A-Level Further Mathematics, to address the needs of this diverse group. Since some incoming students do not have the chance to take these higher qualifications before coming to university, the course fulfils a role as part of the University\u2019s Widening Participation strategy, enabling access to mathematics courses for a wider range of students, e.g. students admitted through contextual admissions. This also was an attempt to address a concern from the University that one reason for undergraduate non-continuation was a lack of preparation for the mathematical components of students\u2019 degree programmes, particularly those students on non-mathematics degrees within the College of Science and Engineering. Increasingly, the second-semester year 1 \"Calculus and its Applications\" course had been adapted to address these problems. However, staff and students felt that it recently contained too much material. FAC aimed to relieve some of the pressure on this course. FAC was delivered as a completely online course to make it scalable, since the above issues are not unique to the School or the University. FAC plays a role in addressing the so-called \u201cmathematics gap\u201d of attainment, preparing students from a wide range of mathematical backgrounds for HE study, and as such could easily see demand both across the University and beyond.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/FAC/#why-use-stack","text":"FAC is essentially a course in mathematical techniques, assessing routine computation.

To solve this problem, developers at Nagoya University are developing a \"flick interface\" for STACK, similar to the popular Japanese keyboard mode. Students can pick a common integer or variable and flick in a direction to quickly turn, for example, x into \\sqrt(x) . A survey of usability suggests students prefer this input type to their traditional keyboard. Motivation As smartphones become increasingly used in schools and universities, it is important to find a reliable way to input mathematical expressions. Inputting mathematics on a computer is not a problem, but on smartphones and other mobile devices it can be much more time-consuming. For example, to type an answer to the question \"Expand (x+2)(x+3)\", students have to enter the expression x^2+5*x+6 into the answer space. On a mobile device, this requires several switches between the alphabetical and numerical views of the keyboard, resulting in 19 key touches for this simple answer. Recently, a flick keyboard for Japanese characters has become very popular in Japan, especially amongst young students. Japanese has three character systems. Hiragana is mostly used for simple and native Japanese words, katakana mostly for foreign words and kanji for all other words. The keyboard shows only a limited number of hiragana[^hiragana] characters, but students can hold and \"flick\" on a key to choose a similar character. Characters are grouped together by sound, for example grouping together na, ni, nu, ne and no. The keyboard will then suggest related kanji and/or katakana characters that share similar sounds. It was the popularity of this keyboard that motivated the developers to create a similar interface for inputting mathematics, as a STACK input type. Execution Figure: The flick interface in action. The flick interface was developed by Yasuyuki Nakamura and Takahiro Nakahara, funded by a grant from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. Like the Japanese character keyboard, students are faced with a small set of common inputs. Students can switch between numerical values and common variables by pressing \"123\" and \"xy\", respectively, or see a full keyboard view by clicking the keyboard logo. Pressing on a number reveals some common manipulations, and students can then flick in one direction to turn, for example, \"2\" into \"2x\". The input is compatible with normal keyboards, and will automatically be selected for the type of device being used. The interface is programmed in JavaScript to minimise the dependency on mobile device operating systems. The interface uses MathDox to describe expressions, and the input is then converted to the Maxima format by a conversion filter previously created by the developers. Developing an interface suitable for all different screen sizes was one of the biggest challenges of the project, but now the interface is suitable for most devices of sizes around 5-6 inches. Results The flick interface is estimated to significantly reduce the number of keypresses required to type an expression. The following table shows an estimated comparison for a few common expressions [1]. Mathematical expression Direct input taps Flick input taps x^2+5x+6 19 8 3x^2-\\frac{2x}{(x^2+1)^2} 36 13 2x \\cos(x^2) 23 7 Table: A comparison of the number of taps needed to type an expression. To analyse the usability of the interface, the developers conducted a usability test at Nagoya University, Japan. 29 students where asked to enter five common maths expressions by using both a traditional keyboard and the new flick input keyboard. After they entered these math expressions, they were given a survey on usability and satisfaction levels. The survey questions were based on the following five parameters, originally from Jakob Nielsen\u2019s five goals of usability [2]: learnability, efficiency, difficulty or ease in making corrections, rememberability, and the intent to reuse. For each parameter, students were asked to give each input type a score from 0.0 to 5.0. The following table shows the results [1], including both the averages, as well as the standard deviations in parentheses. The survey suggests that the usability and satisfaction levels are higher when the flick input method is used to enter mathematical expressions, rather than the direct input method. Question Direct input score Flick input score It is easy to learn how to input math. 3.0 (1.2) 3.5 (1.0) I can input math quickly and easily. 2.6 (1.1) 3.2 (1.3) It is not confusing and easy to correct. 3.0 (1.2) 3.1 (1.1) I remember the method that I learnt at the rehearsal. 3.0 (1.1) 3.1 (1.1) I will use this method to input math the next time 2.9 (1.3) 3.2 (1.4) Table: Responses from the interface survey.

This was done by creating an integrated question type directly in ILIAS. The biggest challenges were decoupling the dependencies on Moodle, and an increasing number of user queries following a quickly growing community. Motivation ILIAS is one of the most popular Learning Management Systems (LMS) used in German universities. It has been available under an open-source license since 2000, and since then has grown in popularity in a number of countries, especially Germany and Switzerland. In the last decade, the ILIAS community started a special-interest group related to mathematical assessment. The main driver for this was the \"optes\" project, a federally funded project to create open learning content for mathematics and natural science. It was key for this project to have a sophisticated question system that uses CAS to evaluate students' input. In 2013, the group compared different systems for CAS based questions and finally decided to use STACK. STACK was initially built for the learning management system Moodle, and it would not be trivial to implement STACK into ILIAS. A crowd funding initiative was started to port the STACK plugin from Moodle to ILIAS, and the Innovation in Learning Institute at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU) was asked to implement and maintain it. This would also be an advantage to FAU, as it could then establish STACK as an innovative element of e-learning and e-assessment at the University. Execution It was important to create an integrated question type that works like all the others in ILIAS, instead of trying to dynamically connect a separate STACK platform to ILIAS. Initially, a 2-day meeting with lead STACK developer Chris Sangwin was held at Loughborough University in December 2013, where the basic architecture and principles of the question type were laid out. In the following months, the ILIAS question type was created. The developers set up a Moodle installation with STACK, examined the code and analysed how it works. Then the \u2018library-like\u2019 Moodle core was extracted and integrated into the template of an ILIAS question plugin. The techniques used followed the open source nature of STACK and were supported by the fact that STACK uses the same technology (PHP/mySQL) as ILIAS. Initially, the only way to add questions was to create them in Moodle, then import the moodleXML file into ILIAS. However, authoring provisions and an authoring interface were later created in ILIAS, using the GUI classes. Results From the beginning, the ILIAS community has shown a great interest in using the integration of STACK. To date, nine separate institutions have participated in the crowd funding of the plugin. Over time, several workshops have been organized by the community. A German user manual and workshops to teach the creation of STACK questions was created at FAU and ported to an online module by the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In 2018, the first international STACK conference was held at the Innovation in Learning Institute, bringing together around 65 participants from the Moodle and ILIAS communities. As hoped, STACK is now being used extensively at FAU for innovative e-assessment. The ILIAS installation at FAU contains around 3000 questions from over 100 different authors. Additionally, a local \u2018STACK user group\u2019 was founded with 40 members from various disciplines, including mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, and economics. Based on external and internal funding, it is possible to permanently provide new major versions of the plugin for each major ILIAS release every year, as well as several minor bug fix versions in between. The core of STACK used by the plugin is also updated every year. The ILIAS questions are fully compatible with the Moodle version and can be exchanged between the two Learning Management Systems through the moodleXML format. Figure: A typical ILIAS question about simplification.. Challenges The biggest challenge for the initial integration of STACK into ILIAS was the decoupling of all dependencies from Moodle in the STACK core. Currently, around 50 patches are maintained for that. Furthermore, there were major differences in ILIAS and Moodle regarding the definition and display of feedback and various test player options. The completely different GUIs of Moodle and ILIAS meant the whole authoring interface of STACK had to be redesigned. When the community of STACK users in ILIAS grew, the number of bug reports related to exotic edge cases of STACK usage also grew. This could, for example, be issues relating to questions with a huge number of inputs. Furthermore, an increasing community of users brought in very different opinions about the styles of a question, its validation and feedback. Dealing with these issues was a significant challenge. A barrier that had to be evaluated is time. The initial work in integrating STACK into ILIAS took significant effort, and the project has to be continually maintained as bug fixes and project features are applied. It is estimated that, on average, 70% of a full-time employee's time is required to maintain the STACK developments for ILIAS. This is currently partially funded by the ILIAS community and the Innovation in Learning Institute. Server performance was an issue when it came to using STACK in large institutions. Maxima was designed as a desktop application, and so lacks a set of \u201cgood practice\u201d recommendations for hardware and configuration options depending on the expected load. To solve this, there are some initiatives such as the GoMaxima project from HAW Hamburg and an initiative at the University of G\u00f6ttingen for a docker swarm of Maxima pools. Enablers The meeting with the lead STACK developer was a major help in getting the project off on the right track. The comprehensive STACK documentation was also invaluable for understanding the question type. Additionally, the support from the ILIAS special interest group was invaluable. This group helped sketch the authoring interface in ILIAS, write documentation and organise the first workshops. It also helped moderate the discussion of feature requests from the ILIAS community and organise crowd funding for the maintenance of the plugin. Furthermore, since the Innovation in Learning Institution is not a mathematics institution, it was invaluable to get help from mathematicians to write good demonstration questions. Finally, the port was supported by the common technology of ILIAS and STACK and the fact Moodle and ILIAS have very similar quiz structures, and both treat STACK as a question plugin type. Implementation differences aside, the main principles are the same. What's Next? The ILIAS question type will continue to be updated as STACK, Moodle and ILIAS get updated. In particular, the way question types in ILIAS are implemented will change in a future ILIAS patch, which means the question type will have to be adapted accordingly. There are also plans to make STACK less dependent on the Moodle library. If this is successful, the ILIAS plugin will have to be largely rewritten (since it depends on the Moodle library), however the developers are optimistic. From writing the question type the first time around, they have gained invaluable experience. Furthermore, the authoring interface will not have to be rewritten. There are many wishes from the ILIAS community for new features to be implemented. Some of these are step-wise feedback, as well as more control of the feedback style, for example the colour of feedback boxes. These may be added to the STACK question type in the future. Finally, the maintenance relies heavily on crowdfunding managed between institutions (typically the Innovation in Learning Institution and another University). This means contracts have to be written between the heads of each institution, which can be difficult to manage. There are therefore considerations to transfer the maintenance of the question type to an ILIAS service provider, as it would then be easier to get crowdfunding contracts from Universities. optes: Optimising Self-study With STACK STACK at Scale: The Open University","title":"ILIAS"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/ILIAS/#technical-integration-of-stack-into-ilias","text":"","title":"Technical Integration of STACK into ILIAS"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/ILIAS/#innovation-in-learning-institute","text":"Interview with Fred Neumann and Jesus Copado","title":"Innovation in Learning Institute"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/ILIAS/#abstract","text":"STACK was integrated into the ILIAS learning management system to support projects for learning content.

Developers from IDEMS and Maseno University created online quizzes for two courses during the pilot of the project, running on servers at the University of Edinburgh. The main challenges of the project were related to poor student access to WiFi and time pressure for the question authors. The feedback from the students was mostly positive, and the pilot paves the way for more similar work in the future. This includes online assessment for many more courses at Maseno University, as well as collaborations with other African universities and secondary schools. Introduction IDEMS International (Innovations on Development, Education and the Mathematical Sciences) is a Community Interest Company working to support different development causes, mostly in Africa, in fields of education and mathematical sciences. The non-profit organisation generates open education resources and offers services to Universities and other institutions. One of their projects was to help implement Computer Aided Assessment (CAA) in African Universities, of which Maseno University was chosen as a pilot. Maseno University, Kenya, has a large number of students in its undergraduate mathematics courses, many courses having 800 enrolled students and some more than 1000, but there is little support for lecturers in terms of marking. This puts pressure on their ability to reliably do weekly assessments for students. By changing the continuous assessment from a paper format to an electronic system, the hope was that lecturers would have more opportunities to concentrate on their teaching and supporting students in other ways. Figure: Maseno University. Why Use STACK? There were a number of reasons for why STACK was chosen for this project. Firstly, there was already some familiarity with the STACK system within IDEMS, as one of the contributors had previously worked with STACK question authoring. Secondly, the main STACK developer offered assistance, including the opportunity to run the service on servers at the University of Edinburgh. Finally, having compared STACK with other systems, the developers found that the flexibility in answer tests, recognition of mistakes through potential response trees and the ability to have questions that require numerical or algebraic input for answers made STACK more powerful than the alternatives. Execution Figure: A STACK question from \"Calculus I\" involving continuity and L'H\u00f4pital's rule. The developers from IDEMS and Maseno University created online STACK quizzes for the courses \"Calculus I\" and \"Introduction to Linear Algebra\". In the case of \"Calculus I\", the main lecturer provided a written quiz structure and list of questions, so the main work was just typing these into STACK and implementing randomisation. In contrast, the quizzes of \"Introduction to Linear Algebra\" were written mostly from scratch, only using a few questions from the STACK sample materials. Initially, students are given a syntax quiz to learn the STACK syntax, and then in each of the following 10 weeks they are given a formative \"mastery quiz\" and a summative \"test quiz\". The mastery quiz can be taken as many times as the students wants, but they must get a score of 80% in the mastery quiz to unlock the respective test quiz, where students are only given one attempt. In \"Introduction to Linear Algebra\", this restriction was later reduced to 70%, as lecturers felt students were having a hard time keeping up with materials. The mastery and test quizzes together count for 30% of the students course grade. Towards the end of the course there is also a review week with STACK questions, and in \"Introduction to Linear Algebra\" students can take an online practice exam. Feedback After the first year, the students of the two courses were asked to fill out a survey about their experience with STACK. The first few questions regarded accessing the course. Maseno University does not have reliable WiFi, and it is not common for students' accommodation to have WiFi either. As a result, most students had to use either their own or a friends' phone, and purchase a data package to access the course. Indeed, when asked to rate the difficulty of different aspects, many students ranked \"accessing the internet\" in the range of \"slightly challenging\" to \"very challenging\". Figure: Responses to the survey for \"Introductory Linear Algebra\". When asked to rate how helpful they found different aspects of the assessments, many students ranked getting feedback, being able to have multiple attempts at mastery quizzes, having weekly quizzes and having the mastery quizzes open all semester as useful. Most students did not seem to have too much difficulty with the STACK syntax, ranking it in a range of \"not a challenge\" to \"moderately challenging\". This was surely helped by the attempts to ensure students were learning the syntax, for example through the introductory syntax quiz. However, it also seems there is room for improvement here. The students were also given an opportunity to add any general comments or suggestions. The majority of these answers were from students who were happy with STACK and said it was useful for getting a deeper understanding of the material. With regards to quizzes, many students requested more than one attempt at test quizzes, with extended deadlines. They requested more mastery quizzes, suggesting they found them helpful, and some students suggested access to harder, exam-style questions. There were also some comments about the feedback for questions. Due to time constraints, the calculus course only had feedback in the form of worked solutions, and for linear algebra, students were only given outlines to solutions. Students said that they wanted better feedback, and so one of the goals for the next iteration will be to add tailored feedback to all questions. Finally, there was a call to improve accessibility for the visually impaired. Challenges As is evident from the survey responses, there was a challenge regarding the students' access to internet. However, this did not end up being as big a problem as anticipated, as students seemed able and willing to pay for data packages to access the course. Furthermore, due to the short term allocation of courses and lecturers, there was a significant time pressure for writing the quizzes. As a result, there was no time to implement tailored feedback, and a number of quizzes were delivered late. However, this did not seem to discourage students or create major issues in the completion of quizzes. Enablers A major enabler for the project was the ability of IDEMS to assist the University in question authoring. The questions were written by Michael Obiero Oyengo and David Ambogo from Maseno University and Santiago Borio, Danny Parsons and David Stern from IDEMS. Additionally, the main STACK developer C. Sangwin helped give crash courses in using STACK, which sped up the learning process. The course was also run on a server at the University of Edinburgh, which meant the developers did not have to worry about setting up a server and could focus entirely on question authoring. Finally, the STACK sample questions helped speed up the question authoring process, as the developers could use them as templates when writing similar questions. What's Next? Following the success of this pilot course, IDEMS is looking to expand into similar projects. The first step will be improving the two initial courses. Once the analysis of the data from the pilot course is finished, it will be possible to identify the main areas that need work. These two courses have been transferred to an IDEMS server, so they can be easily used for online assessment at other universities. The server will be built to cope with universities with many students, as IDEMS expects to use it for some courses with more than 1000 students. A number of Universities have expressed interest in this project, including universities from Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. In particular, the mathematics department at Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia has agreed to investigate implementing a number of IDEMS' courses. In August 2019, IDEMS is holding a workshop , where representatives from these universities will discuss STACK and how to best implement e-assessment at their institutions. The 5-day workshop will include talks on the advantages of using online assessment, as well as practical work to prepare lecturers who want to use IDEMS' online course material. The workshop is funded by a grant from the Commission for Developing Countries (CDC) of the International Mathematical Union. IDEMS is also helping Maseno University create online materials for several of its other courses. In the 19/20 term, Maseno University will run the improved \"Calculus I\", as well as five other courses with online assessment: \"Descriptive Statistics\", \"Introduction to Probability Theory\", \"Basic Mathematics\", \"Calculus II\" and \"Vector Analysis\". For these courses, IDEMS will be training some lecturers to author their own questions, which will increase their control of the online quizzes. As with the two pilot courses, these courses are planned to be piloted at Maseno University first, then refined based on feedback and made available as an OER for other universities. Finally, IDEMS is looking at using STACK in secondary schools. There are plans to develop an e-book for African schools with accompanying STACK questions, including an offline system for schools with poor WiFi. IDEMS is also evaluating opportunities to develop an open assessment system for English schools.

Most students did not seem to have too much difficulty with the STACK syntax, ranking it in a range of \"not a challenge\" to \"moderately challenging\". This was surely helped by the attempts to ensure students were learning the syntax, for example through the introductory syntax quiz. However, it also seems there is room for improvement here. The students were also given an opportunity to add any general comments or suggestions. The majority of these answers were from students who were happy with STACK and said it was useful for getting a deeper understanding of the material. With regards to quizzes, many students requested more than one attempt at test quizzes, with extended deadlines. They requested more mastery quizzes, suggesting they found them helpful, and some students suggested access to harder, exam-style questions. There were also some comments about the feedback for questions. Due to time constraints, the calculus course only had feedback in the form of worked solutions, and for linear algebra, students were only given outlines to solutions. Students said that they wanted better feedback, and so one of the goals for the next iteration will be to add tailored feedback to all questions. Finally, there was a call to improve accessibility for the visually impaired.","title":"Feedback"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/Maseno/#challenges","text":"As is evident from the survey responses, there was a challenge regarding the students' access to internet. However, this did not end up being as big a problem as anticipated, as students seemed able and willing to pay for data packages to access the course. Furthermore, due to the short term allocation of courses and lecturers, there was a significant time pressure for writing the quizzes. As a result, there was no time to implement tailored feedback, and a number of quizzes were delivered late. However, this did not seem to discourage students or create major issues in the completion of quizzes.","title":"Challenges"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/Maseno/#enablers","text":"A major enabler for the project was the ability of IDEMS to assist the University in question authoring. The questions were written by Michael Obiero Oyengo and David Ambogo from Maseno University and Santiago Borio, Danny Parsons and David Stern from IDEMS. Additionally, the main STACK developer C. Sangwin helped give crash courses in using STACK, which sped up the learning process. The course was also run on a server at the University of Edinburgh, which meant the developers did not have to worry about setting up a server and could focus entirely on question authoring. Finally, the STACK sample questions helped speed up the question authoring process, as the developers could use them as templates when writing similar questions.","title":"Enablers"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/Maseno/#whats-next","text":"Following the success of this pilot course, IDEMS is looking to expand into similar projects. The first step will be improving the two initial courses. Once the analysis of the data from the pilot course is finished, it will be possible to identify the main areas that need work. These two courses have been transferred to an IDEMS server, so they can be easily used for online assessment at other universities. The server will be built to cope with universities with many students, as IDEMS expects to use it for some courses with more than 1000 students. A number of Universities have expressed interest in this project, including universities from Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. In particular, the mathematics department at Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia has agreed to investigate implementing a number of IDEMS' courses. In August 2019, IDEMS is holding a workshop , where representatives from these universities will discuss STACK and how to best implement e-assessment at their institutions. The 5-day workshop will include talks on the advantages of using online assessment, as well as practical work to prepare lecturers who want to use IDEMS' online course material. The workshop is funded by a grant from the Commission for Developing Countries (CDC) of the International Mathematical Union. IDEMS is also helping Maseno University create online materials for several of its other courses. In the 19/20 term, Maseno University will run the improved \"Calculus I\", as well as five other courses with online assessment: \"Descriptive Statistics\", \"Introduction to Probability Theory\", \"Basic Mathematics\", \"Calculus II\" and \"Vector Analysis\". For these courses, IDEMS will be training some lecturers to author their own questions, which will increase their control of the online quizzes. As with the two pilot courses, these courses are planned to be piloted at Maseno University first, then refined based on feedback and made available as an OER for other universities. Finally, IDEMS is looking at using STACK in secondary schools. There are plans to develop an e-book for African schools with accompanying STACK questions, including an offline system for schools with poor WiFi. IDEMS is also evaluating opportunities to develop an open assessment system for English schools.

Tim Lowe, School of Mathematics and Statistics, Tim Hunt, Information Technology. Introduction Figure: The Open University. The Open University is the UK\u2019s largest academic institution. In 2017/18 there were approximately 175,000 students studying with the University, mainly part time, making approximately 65,000 full-time equivalent students. Students combine their study with work, family, caring and other responsibilities. Students study from home, at a distance, guided by the University\u2019s Moodle-based VLE and using a combination of online and printed materials. Students are supported by a tutor who provides individual support to a group of typically 20 students and usually offers a combination of face-to-face and online tutorial support. The School of Mathematics and Statistics offers a number of undergraduate qualifications in mathematics (with a total intake of approximately 1300 each year) and a taught MSc, which is the largest such course in the UK. In addition, students throughout the University can take one or more mathematics modules in support of their main subject of study. There are approximately 13,000 student-module combinations within mathematics and statistics each year. STACK is an ideal tool to support the distance-learning of mathematics, as it enables students to practice key techniques from home whilst receiving immediate feedback on their answers. Students can attempt different randomised variants of questions to support their learning and development. Execution Figure: A typical OU STACK question. STACK was first used in the curriculum in 2014 with the launch of a new introductory calculus module: MST124 \"Essential Mathematics I\", which is currently studied by approximately 2,800 students per year. Since then, STACK has been taken up by many modules at all levels. The main use is for formative \u201cpractice quizzes\u201d allowing students to practice the important techniques taught. At lower levels, it is also used for summative assignments, which both encourage students to use the formative quizzes to prepare for the assignment and practice their mathematics, and help students keep on pace with their study by providing deadlines. At the postgraduate level, a series of linked-STACK questions has been developed to guide students through more complex mathematical arguments in the calculus of variations [1]. The School of Mathematics and Statistics have been supporting colleagues in the School of Engineering and Innovation who use STACK to support their teaching of mathematically-based topics. The School is also using STACK to support students between formal module study, and in preparation for study as a key component of online \u201cRevise and Refresh\u201d support materials. STACK is currently used in at least 10 modules providing at total of 330 CATS credits and reaching over 6,500 students annually. Over one million STACK questions are answered by students each year, which is approximately 18% of all quiz questions answered by OU students. Server STACK is supported by the University Information Technology department as part of the Moodle installation. This consists of 11 load-shared Apache Web Servers supported by 2 MaximaPool servers to service the use of Maxima by STACK. Despite the high level of use, STACK has been robust in performance with no unplanned service outages during the period of use. All question authors are strongly encouraged to include Question tests as part of each STACK question, which helps ensure that the integrity of the questions is maintained over time. Before each STACK upgrade, IT checks the question tests of all STACK questions to ensure none are affected by the upgrade. If any tests fail, the questions are corrected by the appropriate module staff before the upgrade is applied to the live system. Feedback Students\u2019 engagement with the quizzes is often demonstrated by comments posted in online forums, for example questioning details of the worked solution provided. Students are often not content with just being able to answer every question in a quiz, but continue to try to correctly answer the quiz in the minimum time. Student feedback on the use of STACK quizzes has been positive, with many choosing to praise them in the unprompted open comments of the university module feedback survey. Conversely, negative comments are received where a module does not have STACK quizzes. Typical student comments include the following: I do value the practice quizzes because you do get practice, the feedback explanations are very good and detailed. [I] have done two runs of the practice quiz which has made a big difference for me and will become something I will be doing much more as [it] helps so much. I have been doing the practice quiz every morning now for 2 weeks ... I managed 100% on one of the quizzes and over 90% now on all of them so my confidence level is going up! The practice quizzes were excellent and I think absolutely essential for consolidating your understanding of the subject. What's Next The School currently plans to introduce STACK quizzes into additional modules as they are updated. Future plans include extending the use of STACK to further, higher level modules and to expand the use of STACK to support students in checking their preparedness for the study of various modules.

The tests were developed and maintained at DHBW Mannheim. Here, students take a diagnostic test, and based on their results are given access to various learning modules, comprising text, graphs, animations, examples and exercises. An analysis of data gathered from the first evaluation phase of the project shows that the pre-course is effective at bridging gaps in school knowledge: at-risk students who end up scoring highly in the pre-course show improved performance in their first year mathematics courses. Introduction Students entering higher education are a diverse group and many students have considerable gaps in school knowledge, putting additional pressure on their first year at university. This particularly applies to mathematics, as basic skills in this subject are considered a prerequisite to successfully complete a course in STEM subjects. As a consequence, many universities provide preparatory courses in mathematics, either face-to-face, web-based, or in blended learning scenarios. The joint research project optes , funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), develops and evaluates learning materials and tools that help students \u201crefresh\u201d their basic knowledge in mathematics and support the development of learning strategies. optes stands for \u201cOptimierung der Selbststudiumsphase\u201d, which translates to \"optimisation of the self-study phase\". Over the course of eight years, optes developed a comprehensive web-based pre-course consisting of diagnostic tests, learning modules and concepts for web-based student support, and tested it at the participating universities. The partner universities include Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) Karlsruhe, DHBW Mannheim, DHBW Mosbach, University of Applied Sciences and Arts Ostwestfalen-Lippe, Universit\u00e4t Hamburg; Cooperating universities: Julius-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, University of Education Heidelberg. Why Use STACK? The project put a strong focus on the development of self-tests that enable learners to apply their knowledge and provide them with meaningful feedback. This required a sophisticated CAA system, especially one that allowed students to enter an algebraic input. Since optes results are published under Creative Commons or General Public licenses, it was also important that the system was open source. To find the most suitable CAA system, the researchers analysed and compared many existing mathematical tools and in 2013, STACK was chosen. One of the reasons for choosing STACK, is that STACK uses the Learning Management System (LMS) Moodle and the Computer Algebra System (CAS) Maxima, both of which are supported by large communities. This gave the researchers confidence that STACK would also be used and developed further. Additionally, STACK is flexible enough to allow researchers to design very different types of mathematical problems. The only barrier was that STACK was not available for the LMS ILIAS at the time, a system widely used in Germany. However a crowd funding initiative was successful in gathering enough funds to implement STACK into ILIAS. Execution The partner university DHBW Mannheim was responsible for the development of tests and self-assessments. Here, a very basic version of the pre-course was implemented in 2013, and based on repeated evaluations, the different tests and learning modules were successively built and improved upon [2]. While some learning resources already existed in the form of printed scripts and paper versions of tests, the complete course material had to be rewritten and typed into ILIAS. In 2019, the course held ten interactive learning modules, with more than 1500 mathematics test items, 140 of which use STACK. Figure 1 shows an overview of the course structure as executed at DHBW Mannheim since 2014. The programme runs in the months leading up to a new semester, and starts with a diagnostic self-test covering the entire pre-course's syllabus. See also recommendations by SEFI mathematics working group [6], and cosh [1]. Depending on their diagnostics test results, students may access the different learning modules. Each course provides text, graphs, animations, examples and exercises, and at the end of each module, students can take a subject-related test consisting of 10 to 15 randomised questions. Students who want additional support can enrol in e-tutored courses, where their learning process is structured and monitored by e-tutors. Students can then discuss problems and test results with peers and e-tutors, and are required to upload completed exercise sheets. During induction week, all participating first year students take a final test at the University\u2019s computer laboratories. Since 2014, more than 2800 students have participated in the diagnostic pre-test and the pre-course at DHBW Mannheim. This corresponds to approximately 560 students per year, which is around 80% of the cohort. Figure: Course design at DHBW Mannheim. While the diagnostic self-test aims at informing learners of their level of knowledge in relation to the curriculum, the self-tests provided in the ten different courses are designed to encourage learners to independently practice their skills. Question Construction Figure 2 shows an example of an optes question in ILIAS. Students can click the checkmark next to the input box to have their answers validated by the system. On top of the question, the student can click to pop-out an explanation of the input syntax. The question is graded by clicking on \u201cR\u00fcckmeldung anfordern\u201d, which means \"Request feedback\". In this example, the student is asked to give an example of a function with three given zeroes. There are no other constraints, and in particular the function can also have more zeroes. The given zeroes are randomly generated, so the student can restart the test to try a variant of the problem with different constants. Figure: An optes question about giving an example of a function with given zeroes. optes questions focus on providing good feedback to students [8]. Feedback incorporates partial marks, if the student for example entered a function with only one or two of the given zeroes, and visuals, by for example graphing the student's answer (in red) against a correct answer (in blue). The student is also shown the value of their function at the three given points and given a model solution. optes questions are great examples of effective use of STACK's feedback features. Figure: Feedback to the example question shown above. Results The major goal of the optes project was to improve students\u2018 self-study abilities in mathematics related subjects. Using data collected from the first evaluations phase of the project, the researchers studied the influence of taking the pre-course on different variables. They found that the biggest factor in study success was a student's previous knowledge and secondary school scores. However, they also found that the pre-course could be very effective at improving first-year performance. Of the students whose performance were at risk, those who scored highly in the pre-course also did better in their first year of study. These were the students with poor prior study success or little domain-related knowledge. Self-test engagement was also found to have significance, as they were related to both pre-course gains and first-year performance. Challenges A major advantage of learning management systems is their ability to provide automated feedback to students. Instructors are hence relieved from the load of marking hundreds of exercises, and students appreciate the immediate response of the system. However, writing feedback for web-based mathematical problems is time-consuming, and these efforts may grow exponentially when the questions have multiple correct answers. To help soften this burden, it is important to share STACK questions, not only across pre-course projects but also across universities and e-learning platforms. Enablers A major enabler for the project was the initiative to integrate STACK into ILIAS. If this crowd funding initiative had failed, optes may have had to choose a less suited CAA system. Furthermore, a lot of institutional support enabled this project. While all resources developed by optes are Open Educational Resources (OER), the implementation of the learning material at third party universities or educational institutions demanded staff and technical infrastructure to install ILIAS and STACK. Staff and technical support helped administer the pre-course and adapt the learning material to each university\u2019s needs. Furthermore, the e-tutor system was enabled by lecturers and older students who took the time to learn to use STACK so they could help pre-course participants as e-tutors. What's Next? Since 2019, the rollout of optes to other universities and institutions has begun, and as more and more lecturers use the optes resources, the STACK community in Germany continues to grow. This community is largely represented by the working group \"Mathe digital\". Lecturers are encouraged to develop and contribute their own questions, resulting in a growing and improving database of available STACK questions. The researchers continue to evaluate the data from the project. When this analysis is finished, it will be possible to better identify the strengths and weaknesses of the course structure. Like all projects funded by the German BMBF programme \"Quality pact for teaching\", optes will be finished by the end of 2020. The developed concepts and course material, however, will be used and developed further at the optes partner universities and at all universities and institutions that share the material. Future plans include incorporating adaptive testing and expanding the work to other subjects and topics, such as mathematics for business and psychology courses.

This required a sophisticated CAA system, especially one that allowed students to enter an algebraic input. Since optes results are published under Creative Commons or General Public licenses, it was also important that the system was open source. To find the most suitable CAA system, the researchers analysed and compared many existing mathematical tools and in 2013, STACK was chosen. One of the reasons for choosing STACK, is that STACK uses the Learning Management System (LMS) Moodle and the Computer Algebra System (CAS) Maxima, both of which are supported by large communities. This gave the researchers confidence that STACK would also be used and developed further. Additionally, STACK is flexible enough to allow researchers to design very different types of mathematical problems. The only barrier was that STACK was not available for the LMS ILIAS at the time, a system widely used in Germany. However a crowd funding initiative was successful in gathering enough funds to implement STACK into ILIAS.","title":"Why Use STACK?"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/optes/#execution","text":"The partner university DHBW Mannheim was responsible for the development of tests and self-assessments. Here, a very basic version of the pre-course was implemented in 2013, and based on repeated evaluations, the different tests and learning modules were successively built and improved upon [2]. While some learning resources already existed in the form of printed scripts and paper versions of tests, the complete course material had to be rewritten and typed into ILIAS. In 2019, the course held ten interactive learning modules, with more than 1500 mathematics test items, 140 of which use STACK. Figure 1 shows an overview of the course structure as executed at DHBW Mannheim since 2014. The programme runs in the months leading up to a new semester, and starts with a diagnostic self-test covering the entire pre-course's syllabus. See also recommendations by SEFI mathematics working group [6], and cosh [1]. Depending on their diagnostics test results, students may access the different learning modules. Each course provides text, graphs, animations, examples and exercises, and at the end of each module, students can take a subject-related test consisting of 10 to 15 randomised questions. Students who want additional support can enrol in e-tutored courses, where their learning process is structured and monitored by e-tutors. Students can then discuss problems and test results with peers and e-tutors, and are required to upload completed exercise sheets. During induction week, all participating first year students take a final test at the University\u2019s computer laboratories. Since 2014, more than 2800 students have participated in the diagnostic pre-test and the pre-course at DHBW Mannheim. This corresponds to approximately 560 students per year, which is around 80% of the cohort. Figure: Course design at DHBW Mannheim. While the diagnostic self-test aims at informing learners of their level of knowledge in relation to the curriculum, the self-tests provided in the ten different courses are designed to encourage learners to independently practice their skills.","title":"Execution"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2019/optes/#question-construction","text":"Figure 2 shows an example of an optes question in ILIAS.

The question is graded by clicking on \u201cR\u00fcckmeldung anfordern\u201d, which means \"Request feedback\". In this example, the student is asked to give an example of a function with three given zeroes. There are no other constraints, and in particular the function can also have more zeroes. The given zeroes are randomly generated, so the student can restart the test to try a variant of the problem with different constants. Figure: An optes question about giving an example of a function with given zeroes. optes questions focus on providing good feedback to students [8]. Feedback incorporates partial marks, if the student for example entered a function with only one or two of the given zeroes, and visuals, by for example graphing the student's answer (in red) against a correct answer (in blue). The student is also shown the value of their function at the three given points and given a model solution. optes questions are great examples of effective use of STACK's feedback features.

However, they also found that the pre-course could be very effective at improving first-year performance. Of the students whose performance were at risk, those who scored highly in the pre-course also did better in their first year of study. These were the students with poor prior study success or little domain-related knowledge.

Staff and technical support helped administer the pre-course and adapt the learning material to each university\u2019s needs.

The researchers continue to evaluate the data from the project. When this analysis is finished, it will be possible to better identify the strengths and weaknesses of the course structure. Like all projects funded by the German BMBF programme \"Quality pact for teaching\", optes will be finished by the end of 2020. The developed concepts and course material, however, will be used and developed further at the optes partner universities and at all universities and institutions that share the material.

In a blended-learning scenario, the self-study component includes quizzes with STACK questions. These questions were implemented with a specific focus on the needs of non-traditional students, e.g. providing support for dealing with input syntax and using partial crediting. The questions use several of STACK's input types, including multiple-choice questions, which help establish successful mathematical practice. Both lecturers and students emphasize the importance of STACK for the program's success. Introduction Figure: A statue near OTH Amberg-Weiden. In Germany, there are various opportunities to enrol at universities to study a vocational qualification instead of a higher education degree.\u00b9 For example, people with certain professional degrees, such as technicians, get a general university entrance qualification. Often these students do not have the mathematical prior knowledge which is expected by universities in STEM and business fields. Furthermore, the widespread bridging courses are usually not enough for this audience, and they require more extensive extra-occupational mathematics courses. At the Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule (OTH) Amberg-Weiden there is a long tradition of preparation courses for students with vocational backgrounds. Over time these courses have been adapted to changes in the legal framework and were further developed between 2016 and 2018 into the program BeVorStudium. The joint project \"OTH mind\", funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, developed a blended learning scenario that included STACK quizzes. A majority of participants are in their mid-twenties, have a vocational education in the technical area and aim for studies like mechanical or electrical engineering or computer science. Institutions who are offering preparation courses for this audience face several challenges. One is the high number of topics to be covered in just a few months. Another is the limited number of time slots for in-person courses, with participants typically having a full-time job. This makes the self-study component an important part of the course. STACK is well-suited for the self-study environment, helping students apply new notions to routine problems and get individual feedback. Execution BeVorStudium consists of two mathematics modules (plus one module in physics). Mathematics I contains topics typically included in middle grade syllabi, in particular elementary algebra. Mathematics II deals with important content from senior grades, especially calculus. In-person courses take place every other weekend, combined with an online based self-study component in between. Students are encouraged to complete regular online quizzes with STACK questions, discussed in detail in [2]. Each quiz consists of six to ten normally multi-part STACK questions. When designing the quizzes, the following criteria were followed to meet the needs of non-traditional students: Input support . Some participants, being out of school for many years, consistently struggle with the input syntax. Therefore quizzes always provide syntax hints, and make use of STACK's tools for syntax validation. For example, answers are not accepted unless they are of the same type (e.g. equation, number, etc.) as the model answer. Partial credits . Partial credit is used extensively to keep students motivated, and reward correct ideas where possible. Specific feedback . Questions put an emphasis on \"specific feedback\" rather than \"general feedback\". Specific feedback addresses individual mistakes, and provides positive feedback on correct ideas. If a question includes general feedback too, this usually provides an illustration of the correct answer or a hint to the approach but not a model solution. Questions and model solutions can be discussed in class, which, according to the lecturer, usually takes a significant amount of \"well invested\" time. Variety of input types. In mathematical practice it is important to have a variety of material, approaches and perspectives [3]. To support this idea, the quizzes use a variety of input types. Besides a majority of questions with algebraic input there are also interactive JSX-Graphs and regular multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Figure: A question about differentiating. The student is given partial credits for finding a correct numerator and incorrect denominator. Multiple-Choice Questions Although there are a number of problems connected to the use of MCQs in the assessment of STEM subjects - for example, when dealing with reversible mathematical processes - there are situations when this question format is more appropriate than others [4, 5]. In the preparation program, BeVorStudium MCQs serve various purposes: Avoiding syntax issues. As mentioned previously, some participants struggle with input syntax. MCQs give students the option to just focus on the (new) mathematics first, without worrying about the syntax. Addressing different learning objectives . While questions with algebraic input often assess mathematical skills, MCQs are suitable for the assessment of conceptual and procedural knowledge as well as conceptual understanding. Establishing high quality practice . Different input types help establish a variety of perspectives and connections in practice (see above) and meet the needs of different types of learners. Figure: In this question, students are asked to select all odd functions. The functions can be randomly generated and the feedback is specific to the student's individual selection. Since Moodle has built-in support for MCQs, it might seem unnecessary to use STACK for these questions. However, STACK comes with its own set of MCQ input types. Besides having a consistent layout in all questions, STACK's MCQs have several features that improve the didactical quality of the questions: Developing interesting question formats . STACK enables authors to implement multiple-choice formats which are recommended for university level assessment [6] like multiple True/False or matching questions. Using typical STACK features . Many STACK features such as randomization, partial crediting and in particular differentiated feedback can also be used in MCQs. For example, it is possible to give feedback on options of a checkbox question which are not chosen, or to point out contradictions between certain options. Implementing multi-part questions . There are typical mathematics problems which not only require a numerical or algebraic answer but also some verbal addition (\"What is the type of the extremum?\", \"Is this answer unique?\", \"What is the monotonic behaviour of the function?\" etc.). These questions are implemented well through STACK MCQ. Efficiency . Using STACK-MCQs can be very efficient, especially when using Maxima plots. An implemented question can be used as a template for similar questions that use another class of functions or another set of propositions. Figure: A matching question that uses Maxima plots. Results The experience at the OTH Amberg-Weiden is that non-traditional students value in-person classes. It is therefore important to maintain a close connection between online quizzes and in-person lectures. By doing so, a majority of students also complete the STACK quizzes. During the trial period of the course in 2018 on average 97.2% (Mathematics I, N=9) and 62.5% (Mathematics II, N=16) of active participants\u00b2 completed the STACK quizzes. These percentages were similar in subsequent years. The integration of STACK questions led to an increased amount of time used for self-study. In the 2018 evaluation of the module Mathematics II, eight out of ten respondents said they invested more than three hours per week on self-study - in addition to a full-time job and extensive in person lectures. Both students and lecturers acknowledge the importance of STACK as a part of the preparation program. Individual feedback of alumni shows that some participants pass their math exam at the end of the first term with a good or even very good result. What's next? After three years of using STACK within BeVorStudium, questions have been consistently improved. There are however some approaches for further development: Extending the specific feedback. The specific feedback still mainly focuses on deficits (\"You have done something wrong\"), and should be extended to address correct ideas as well. Making exercises problem oriented . Problem orientation is a principle of successful mathematical practice [3], and means to give exercises a superordinate perspective. This can be achieved by adding reflective MCQs. Considering different approaches . Currently most of the questions focus on the result rather than the approach. Implementing questions that focus on the approach could help students better understand mathematical methods and identify mistakes.

In Germany, there are various opportunities to enrol at universities to study a vocational qualification instead of a higher education degree.\u00b9 For example, people with certain professional degrees, such as technicians, get a general university entrance qualification. Often these students do not have the mathematical prior knowledge which is expected by universities in STEM and business fields. Furthermore, the widespread bridging courses are usually not enough for this audience, and they require more extensive extra-occupational mathematics courses. At the Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule (OTH) Amberg-Weiden there is a long tradition of preparation courses for students with vocational backgrounds. Over time these courses have been adapted to changes in the legal framework and were further developed between 2016 and 2018 into the program BeVorStudium. The joint project \"OTH mind\", funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, developed a blended learning scenario that included STACK quizzes. A majority of participants are in their mid-twenties, have a vocational education in the technical area and aim for studies like mechanical or electrical engineering or computer science. Institutions who are offering preparation courses for this audience face several challenges. One is the high number of topics to be covered in just a few months. Another is the limited number of time slots for in-person courses, with participants typically having a full-time job. This makes the self-study component an important part of the course. STACK is well-suited for the self-study environment, helping students apply new notions to routine problems and get individual feedback.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2020/OTH/#execution","text":"BeVorStudium consists of two mathematics modules (plus one module in physics). Mathematics I contains topics typically included in middle grade syllabi, in particular elementary algebra. Mathematics II deals with important content from senior grades, especially calculus. In-person courses take place every other weekend, combined with an online based self-study component in between. Students are encouraged to complete regular online quizzes with STACK questions, discussed in detail in [2]. Each quiz consists of six to ten normally multi-part STACK questions. When designing the quizzes, the following criteria were followed to meet the needs of non-traditional students: Input support . Some participants, being out of school for many years, consistently struggle with the input syntax. Therefore quizzes always provide syntax hints, and make use of STACK's tools for syntax validation. For example, answers are not accepted unless they are of the same type (e.g. equation, number, etc.) as the model answer. Partial credits . Partial credit is used extensively to keep students motivated, and reward correct ideas where possible. Specific feedback . Questions put an emphasis on \"specific feedback\" rather than \"general feedback\". Specific feedback addresses individual mistakes, and provides positive feedback on correct ideas. If a question includes general feedback too, this usually provides an illustration of the correct answer or a hint to the approach but not a model solution. Questions and model solutions can be discussed in class, which, according to the lecturer, usually takes a significant amount of \"well invested\" time. Variety of input types. In mathematical practice it is important to have a variety of material, approaches and perspectives [3]. To support this idea, the quizzes use a variety of input types. Besides a majority of questions with algebraic input there are also interactive JSX-Graphs and regular multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Figure: A question about differentiating. The student is given partial credits for finding a correct numerator and incorrect denominator.","title":"Execution"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2020/OTH/#multiple-choice-questions","text":"Although there are a number of problems connected to the use of MCQs in the assessment of STEM subjects - for example, when dealing with reversible mathematical processes - there are situations when this question format is more appropriate than others [4, 5]. In the preparation program, BeVorStudium MCQs serve various purposes: Avoiding syntax issues. As mentioned previously, some participants struggle with input syntax. MCQs give students the option to just focus on the (new) mathematics first, without worrying about the syntax. Addressing different learning objectives . While questions with algebraic input often assess mathematical skills, MCQs are suitable for the assessment of conceptual and procedural knowledge as well as conceptual understanding. Establishing high quality practice . Different input types help establish a variety of perspectives and connections in practice (see above) and meet the needs of different types of learners. Figure: In this question, students are asked to select all odd functions. The functions can be randomly generated and the feedback is specific to the student's individual selection. Since Moodle has built-in support for MCQs, it might seem unnecessary to use STACK for these questions. However, STACK comes with its own set of MCQ input types. Besides having a consistent layout in all questions, STACK's MCQs have several features that improve the didactical quality of the questions: Developing interesting question formats . STACK enables authors to implement multiple-choice formats which are recommended for university level assessment [6] like multiple True/False or matching questions. Using typical STACK features . Many STACK features such as randomization, partial crediting and in particular differentiated feedback can also be used in MCQs. For example, it is possible to give feedback on options of a checkbox question which are not chosen, or to point out contradictions between certain options. Implementing multi-part questions . There are typical mathematics problems which not only require a numerical or algebraic answer but also some verbal addition (\"What is the type of the extremum?\", \"Is this answer unique?\", \"What is the monotonic behaviour of the function?\" etc.). These questions are implemented well through STACK MCQ. Efficiency . Using STACK-MCQs can be very efficient, especially when using Maxima plots. An implemented question can be used as a template for similar questions that use another class of functions or another set of propositions. Figure: A matching question that uses Maxima plots.","title":"Multiple-Choice Questions"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2020/OTH/#results","text":"The experience at the OTH Amberg-Weiden is that non-traditional students value in-person classes. It is therefore important to maintain a close connection between online quizzes and in-person lectures. By doing so, a majority of students also complete the STACK quizzes. During the trial period of the course in 2018 on average 97.2% (Mathematics I, N=9) and 62.5% (Mathematics II, N=16) of active participants\u00b2 completed the STACK quizzes. These percentages were similar in subsequent years. The integration of STACK questions led to an increased amount of time used for self-study. In the 2018 evaluation of the module Mathematics II, eight out of ten respondents said they invested more than three hours per week on self-study - in addition to a full-time job and extensive in person lectures. Both students and lecturers acknowledge the importance of STACK as a part of the preparation program. Individual feedback of alumni shows that some participants pass their math exam at the end of the first term with a good or even very good result.","title":"Results"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2020/OTH/#whats-next","text":"After three years of using STACK within BeVorStudium, questions have been consistently improved. There are however some approaches for further development: Extending the specific feedback. The specific feedback still mainly focuses on deficits (\"You have done something wrong\"), and should be extended to address correct ideas as well. Making exercises problem oriented . Problem orientation is a principle of successful mathematical practice [3], and means to give exercises a superordinate perspective. This can be achieved by adding reflective MCQs. Considering different approaches . Currently most of the questions focus on the result rather than the approach. Implementing questions that focus on the approach could help students better understand mathematical methods and identify mistakes. This could be implemented by asking for certain extensions or using the \"Equivalence reasoning\" input type.","title":"What's next?"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2020/OTH/#references","text":"[1] Kultusministerkonferenz.

They were designed as flexible learning resources and have been used by an estimate of 12,000 students in 55 UK higher and further education sites [1]. During the ongoing pandemic, as more and more teaching moves to online spaces, the universities of Edinburgh and Loughborough, with the help of several other institutions, have undertaken an effort of translating the HELM materials into Moodle quizzes. This effort was supported with funding from the U21 Global Educational Enhancement Fund [2], which mainly enabled interns (including Ilyas and Adri\u00e1n) to be employed on the project. The newly-created Moodle quizzes very much follow the spirit of the original workbooks but provide the added value of interactivity through STACK questions. The result will be released as an Open Educational Resource (OER) on the University of Edinburgh website. Execution So far, about half of the workbooks have been made into Moodle quizzes. Most of the quizzes corresponding to workbooks 1\u201319 and 35\u201339 were created during the summer of 2020. These include all the exposition and worked examples as description boxes, and STACK versions of most of the tasks and exercises in each workbook. The materials covered by these quizzes include: Basic algebra and elementary functions Linear algebra Complex numbers Calculus and differential equations Probability Feedback from students and lecturers was gathered and acted upon during an extensive revision of the material during the summer of 2021, prior to their public release. This also ensured consistency of style and resulted in the creation of new quizzes and addition of interactive graphs to some questions using JSXGraph. Currently, there are over 90 quizzes with an average of 6\u20138 STACK questions each. Most questions have algebraic or numerical inputs, but some are implemented as multiple choice questions, which better suit the nature of the original HELM exercise. Except where it was not possible, question statements were randomised so that students can practice with different versions of the same exercise. Special care was taken to set up relevant tests, to ensure each question is working as expected and to flag issues in future edits. The following screenshots provide some highlights from the HELM quizzes. Interactive plot with JSXGraph. Students can change the number of rectangles in the left Riemann sum to help them understand the definition of an integral an answer the question. Interactive plot with JSXGraph. Students can pan and zoom to explore how the Newton\u2013Raphson method works. HELM task as a STACK question. Part (b) is assessed with the SysEquiv answer test to allow for different equivalent forms of the correct equation. Putting the quizzes to work The HELM quizzes have been used in the Engineering Mathematics 1A and 1B (360 students) and Mathematics for Natural Sciences 1A and 1B (130 students) courses at the University of Edinburgh during the 2020/21 academic year. The courses also had online lectures and tutorials, and the HELM quizzes were mostly used for self-study. Each week, 3 or 4 quizzes were made available to students, which would serve as an introduction to the topics to be covered. These were intended as formative feedback and thus did not impact the student\u2019s final grade, but they could be used as practice for the assessed quiz due at the beginning of the following week. Student reception The students\u2019 engagement with the HELM materials was encouraging. In the Engineering Mathematics courses, each quiz typically received between 250 and 300 complete attempts on the week it was released. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive \u2013 some students found the HELM quizzes to be the most valuable part of the course. They particularly appreciated being able to work at their own pace and how the quizzes assumed little or no previous knowledge, a trait inherited from the original workbooks. Students also pointed to some areas that needed improvement, such as worked solutions, which were addressed during the 2021 summer revision. Conclusion Bringing new life to the HELM workbooks in the form of STACK quizzes has proved to be a very fruitful activity. The upfront effort to develop STACK questions has added great value to the online learning experience, through question randomisation and immediate feedback. The quizzes created so far cover most of the contents of first year engineering mathematics, applicable also to other subjects, and demonstrate how STACK can be used to teach a wide variety of topics. The work is nevertheless far from over. Around half of the HELM workbooks are yet to be translated into Moodle. Several other universities are interested in using the existing materials in their courses, and further progress will be made prioritising the workbooks that would be of most use to course organisers. In addition to this, it would be interesting to explore the use of interactive graphs as question inputs, which would enable certain types of \u2018sketch\u2019 questions in the original workbooks to be transferred to STACK. Lastly, the quizzes will soon be released as an OER, which will allow students all over the world to use them for self-study.

In the summer of 2020, we turned to STACK with the goal of creating self-assessed online quizzes in real analysis that would supplement traditional problem sheets. We wanted to see how far STACK could be used in a heavily proof-based pure mathematics undergraduate course. Time line Coding phase: June - August 2020 Testing phase: September - December 2020 Launch: January to March 2021 Feedback and data analysis: April 2021 We worked on the module Analysis II - a core first-year module for maths undergraduates at Warwick. The intake was about 400. This is second course in real analysis follows from the foundation in numbers, sequences and series in Analysis I. Teaching materials, including online quizzes, were to be created on the Moodle virtual learning environment. Here is the weekly scope of the course given over 10 weeks. \\epsilon-\\delta definition of continuity Sequential definition of continuity Continuity on an interval, Intermediate Value Theorem Limits Inverse Function Theorem Differentiation, Carath\u00e9odory\u2019s theorem Mean Value Theorem, L\u2019H\u00f4pital\u2019s Rule Taylor\u2019s Theorem, Lagrange form of the remainder Radius of convergence Differentiation of power series Our goal was to create one set of STACK assessment for each week\u2019s material. Each set should take around 30-40 minutes to complete. Execution In the previous year, students had to submit problem sheets weekly, However, Covid-related uncertainties meant that we had to cut this number down to only 4 problem sheets, which counted for 10% of the final grade. To supplement the above, we created 11 sets of STACK quizzes, two of which were not counted (one on syntax training, and one on Analysis I revision). They were practice quizzes, in the sense that students could do them an unlimited number of times before the deadline, each attempt building on the last. Each quiz had a pass mark of around 85% (not uniform across the quizzes). Passing 6 out of 9 quizzes gave the student a flat 5% for the module. We used STACK to create over 40 multi-part questions over 4 weeks. We are grateful for George Kinnear\u2019s talk on JSXGraph at previous STACK conferences, and to Chris Sangwin and Robbie Bickerton, both of whom gave us inspirations to apply their scaffolding and proof-comprehension techniques to Analysis II. We used STACK in conjunction with Moodle-type questions (STACK integrated seamlessly with our Moodle virtual learning environment). We particularly found JSXGraph helpful in creating interactive graphics that visualise and explain tricky analysis concepts better than static media could. Highlights include the questions shown in these figures. \u03b5-\u03b4 definition of continuity visualised with JSXgraph and slider. Counterexamples in analysis can be visualised with JSXgraph\u2019s zoom function (e.g. to explore local behaviour of a function). A proof of the Chain Rule is implemented using Moodle\u2019s \u2018drag and drop\u2019 question type together with STACK-coded scaffolded proof. Results We set the pass mark for each assignment quite high (>80%) but most students achieved >90%. On average students submitted between 2 and 3 attempts per quiz, with over 90% of students passing all quizzes. These engagement statistics are all encouraging. Student feedback When asked: \u201cApart from the lecture notes and videos, what other resources are useful for the understanding of Analysis II?\u201d, we found that almost 90% of respondents rated the quizzes as useful. As many students rated the problem sheets as useful. This is evidence that when implemented properly, the learning gains from STACK quizzes are comparable to those of traditional pen-and-paper assignments. When asked to \u201cName one thing about the module which has had the most impact on your learning in this course\u201d, a number of students thought the STACK quizzes were the most impactful element of the course. Some comments include: \u201cThe quizzes were helpful and the infinite attempts ensured that I did not feel pressured while doing them, allowing me to focus on understanding the content.\" \u201cThe quizzes have been a very useful interactive learning tool.\" \u201cThe alternating assessment format between quizzes and written assignments is nice and helped reduce stress.\" Summary STACK can be successfully applied to a wide range of mathematics content, including pure mathematics at university level as our work has demonstrated. We have shown that it is possible to turn proofs in existing lecture notes and problem sheets into interactive online quizzes, even in pure proof-heavy courses like ours. The interactivity in the STACK quizzes also meant that students understood the proofs much more clearly than when the proofs were recited during lectures. Although STACK was the primary tool for question creation, we also found it useful to mix STACK with other native Moodle-type questions for a varied diet. Creating questions on STACK is an ideal co-creation project which can be done as a summer internship. There are long-term benefits for everyone involved. All in all, we found STACK to be highly flexible and adaptable to help us achieve our teaching-and-learning goals. At Warwick we are continuing to expand the use of STACK to other maths modules.

We used STACK in conjunction with Moodle-type questions (STACK integrated seamlessly with our Moodle virtual learning environment). We particularly found JSXGraph helpful in creating interactive graphics that visualise and explain tricky analysis concepts better than static media could. Highlights include the questions shown in these figures. \u03b5-\u03b4 definition of continuity visualised with JSXgraph and slider. Counterexamples in analysis can be visualised with JSXgraph\u2019s zoom function (e.g. to explore local behaviour of a function).

We have shown that it is possible to turn proofs in existing lecture notes and problem sheets into interactive online quizzes, even in pure proof-heavy courses like ours. The interactivity in the STACK quizzes also meant that students understood the proofs much more clearly than when the proofs were recited during lectures. Although STACK was the primary tool for question creation, we also found it useful to mix STACK with other native Moodle-type questions for a varied diet. Creating questions on STACK is an ideal co-creation project which can be done as a summer internship. There are long-term benefits for everyone involved. All in all, we found STACK to be highly flexible and adaptable to help us achieve our teaching-and-learning goals. At Warwick we are continuing to expand the use of STACK to other maths modules. Extra-Occupational Bridging Courses for Non-Traditional Students Translating the HELM workbooks to STACK","title":"Summary"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2022/HonoursComplexVariables/","text":"Overview Use of STACK in Honours Complex Variables Context Complex analysis is a classical branch of pure mathematics, and one of the high points of human intellectual achievement. The University of Edinburgh complex analysis course, Honours Complex Variables , is typically taken by around 250 students annually, mostly in Year 3 of Mathematics BSc/MMath degrees. The course covers the following topics: holomorphic functions, the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and multivalued functions; conformal maps, the extended complex plane, Riemann sphere, and M\u00f6bius transformations; Cauchy's Integral Theorem, and the (Generalized) Cauchy Integral Theorem; Liouville's Theorem and the Maximum Modulus Principle; Taylor and Laurent Series; zeros, singularities, residues, and the Cauchy Residue Theorem; and evaluation of real integrals using contour integrals. The course content is based on an established set of course notes (around 80 pages) written by Dr Richard Gratwick, the current course organiser. The notes contain the background theory, proofs, examples and some exercises for the students to practise. Students were expected to work on them while they were studying each lecture's content. In addition to the exercises there are also tasks used in face to face workshops. Execution Traditionally, the course would have had three 50-minute whole-class lectures and one 50-minute workshop each week. In the academic year 2021-22, the course was redesigned in response to constraints imposed by pandemic restrictions. The course ran with two 50-minute synchronous digital lectures each week, in which the lecturer used a form of flipped classroom with polling in Zoom, and one 50-minute in-person workshop. The notes were converted from a static PDF to a collection of quizzes in the STACK service. Each week the students had 3-4 STACK quizzes, and taking into consideration the design of the quizzes, we estimate that the students would need 1-2 hours to work through each of them. So, each week we expect the students to spend 10-12 hours on the course in total (contact hours, quizzes, workshop, assignments). The STACK quizzes were used for practise and they didn't contribute towards the final mark of the course. This redesign was influenced by the previous work at the University of Edinburgh developing two fully online courses Fundamentals of Algebra and Calculus (FAC) and Introductory Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) [1]. The resources for Honours Complex Variables were created by Richard Gratwick, Steven O\u2019Hagan, the postgraduate intern Ivona Gjeroska and the undergraduate interns Maddy Baron and Xie Jin Ng, in collaboration with Giampaolo D\u2019Alessandro (University of Southampton). The redesign aimed to be future-proof in the sense that materials created should be suitable for reuse in subsequent years, with iterated improvements, even when a return to fully on-campus teaching is possible. Results A typical pattern of content from the resource is shown in following figure. We see a definition followed a short discussion and video clip of a worked example by the lecturer. Then we have a STACK question inviting the student to check their own understanding of the material. In addition, each unit of work started with a video of the lecturer giving a high-level overview and motivation of the material to come. Figure: Example of content of a typical quiz. Here are some examples of notable questions created for this course. Figure: A question asking to construct the harmonic conjugate of a function. The fully worked solution appears immediately after the students submit their answer. Figure: A Taylor series question. Figure: A question asking to classify singularities.The classification of each singularity appears as a drop-down list. Figure: A multipart STACK question on trigonometric integrals. In the future, such sessions could easily translate to on-campus activities using peer instruction, which had been an established practice in the School before the pandemic. Students' engagement Student feedback on the course was overwhelmingly positive, with one student responding to the end-of-course survey as follows. \u201cGenuinely this course has been the perfect mix of activities for my learning, I\u2019d go as far say to the best organised course I\u2019ve taken in SoM, certainly this year anyway. The notes being delivered in stack are great and much more engaging than a pdf (the supplementary pdf is much more easy to navigate for finding Theorems etc. however), which actually makes me do all the reading before lectures so I gain so much more from them. Stack is good in part because of the instant feedback on most exercises which are immediately relevant to what you\u2019re learning, but also because it breaks the material up well. Stack being the main resource works in perfectly with the 2 lectures delivered a week and the tutorial. SoM should considering delivering all courses in this fashion.\u201d The course organiser, Richard Gratwick, said: \u201cI believe the redesign of this course has been highly successful, and I like to consider the mode of delivery as a prototype for courses of the future. The motivation was to reflect on the innovations forced upon on us during the pandemic and attempt to implement in a considered way those that proved valuable. Recording short videos of examples and calculations allowed me to present these items \u201cdynamically\u201d, rather than as plain text, but freed up time in synchronous lectures for me to engage with more conceptual high-level discussion of the material. The Stack questions for self-assessment were largely based on exercises included in the previous version of the written notes, but students engaged with them much more regularly when they were presented in the online workbooks \u2013 my impression was that in previous years these written exercises were largely ignored. Challenges Redesigning a 3rd Year course, so that it contains a substantial amount of online components, was a challenging procedure. Authoring questions from scratch: a lot of the STACK questions had to be created completely from scratch because we didn't have any similar questions used in other courses. Deciding how to deliver each part of the course: it required careful though to decide which of the questions included in the lecture notes to have as exercise for students to solve or as a written example or as a worked example in a video. Some parts of the course can not be assessed automatically. After some consideration the lecturer decided to move some of the easy workshop questions into STACK and used the workshop time to address more complicated questions. Conclusions Online assessment it typically used for larger classes in early years of a university mathematics degree, such as calculus or linear algebra. These courses have a strong methods component. As the subject progresses, especially where there is a focus on mathematical proof, it is harder to write online questions which assess the key concepts. As a community we are gaining experience in using quizzes to structure learning materials (rather then traditional lectures), and in supporting more advanced courses. For example the University of Warwick used self-assessed online quizzes in real analysis that would supplement traditional problem sheets. In this course we have demonstrated that STACK can be successfully applied to a higher-level course to promote students' engagement with the content of the course. This is not as straightforward as in calculus and linear algebra, but nevertheless with careful design of materials it is possible to support students online with STACK in advanced courses such as complex analysis.

Question Answering in STACK Applying String Similarity Maseno University Workshop 2022","title":"Conclusions"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2022/MasenoWorkshop/","text":"Overview Maseno University Workshop 2022 Abstract Maseno University has continually worked with IDEMS International to create online STACK assessment resources for nine courses over the last four years. Lecturers at Maseno, and from other universities within East Africa; Strathmore University, Kenya, University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia, have successfully used STACK in students' assessments as part of formative and summative assessment in the form of CAT contributions in their courses. The School of Mathematics Statistics and Actuarial Science (SMSAS), at Maseno, intends to create STACK quizzes for all of their courses as one of their long-term goals. This is a report on a 5-day STACK workshop held at Maseno in July 2022, from the 4th to the 8th. The goal of the workshop was to share resources developed at Maseno University with learning institutions in East Africa, and establish a community of users who can collaborate on the same to improve mathematics education. The workshop drew a total of 48 participants from various institutions both locally within Kenya and from Tanzania and Ethiopia, and more expressed interest. During the workshop, there was a discussion about an ambitious plan by INNODEMS (IDEMS affiliate) to recruit recent college graduates as interns, and train them in authoring STACK question types so as to help lecturers implement STACK in their courses. Figure: Attendees of the Maseno University Workshop 2022. Introduction As reported in a previous Case study report Innovating Education in Maseno, Kenya , Maseno University held a workshop on electronic assessment in mathematics in August 2019, with participants from Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda in attendance. The primary goal of that workshop was to train lecturers on how to use STACK in formative and summative assessment of students. Since then, Bahir Dar University (Ethiopia), has used STACK for practice without giving credit to students for engaging with the resources. However, after the 2022 workshop held at Maseno, there have been plans in using STACK at Bahir Dar for formative assessment as from September 2022. Apart from Maseno University, the University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), has also successfully used STACK in formative and summative continuous assessment since the 2019 workshop in three of its courses, Numerical Analysis, Calculus of One Variable and Differential Equations for Non-Majors. Some Kenyan universities have been inconsistent with using STACK in assessment, which is what this 2022 workshop hoped to address. In Uganda and Rwanda, there has been no feedback on the use of STACK. STACK resources developed at Maseno were uploaded in the IDEMS server to allow participants in the workshop to access them. Calculus I & Calculus II Descriptive Statistics Basic Mathematics Vector Analysis Complex Analysis 1 & Complex Analysis II Measure Theory Linear Algebra 1 Resources in these courses are also being reviewed to improve the quality of feedback provided to students for the next semester, which begins in September 2022. Probability Theory and Foundations of Pure Mathematics are two more courses under development. The 5 day workshop attracted participants from the following learning institutions; African Maths Initiative Interns, Kenya - 9 INNODEMS, Kenya - 3 Alupe University, Kenya- 2 Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia - 2 Kaimosi Friends University College, Kenya - 4 Kisii University, Kenya- 1 Maseno University, Kenya - 8 Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology, Kenya- 9 Rongo University, Kenya - 1 Strathmore University, Kenya- 4 Turkana University, Kenya - 2 University of Eastern Africa, Baraton, Kenya - 1 University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania - 1 Kibabii University, Kenya - 1 Objectives of the Workshop The main goal of the 5-day workshop was divided into the following objectives; Increase the awareness of STACK through presentations on how to use it, its benefits, and the freely available resources tailored to teaching and assessment of undergraduate mathematics courses. Furthermore, to also inform participants on the possibility of IDEMS, INNODEMS, and AMI assistance, as implementing partners when it comes to supporting the use of STACK and the creation of resources. Give lecturers practical experience with STACK and Moodle course organization through working on a course they intend to teach in the coming academic year, most likely to commence on the September of 2022. Create a community of STACK users in Kenya and East Africa as a whole, who will work together on improving undergraduate mathematics education through open initiatives, creating new materials and sharing the available resources, besides networking. Summary of the Workshop Program This section summarizes the daily events that took place as part of the workshop from 4th to 8th July, 2022. On the first day, a presentation on the features of STACK and its usage at Maseno University was done by Dr. Isaac Owino (The Chair of the Math Department). Lecturers in the workshop were then allowed to peruse the available courses created by Maseno and IDEMS international, identify a course they\u2019d be working on to ready it for delivery in their various institutions, and form collaborative groups during the workshop. Copies of the courses were then created and participants enrolled in readiness for the next agenda, customizing the existing content to suit individual needs. Organizing content in the course, structuring resources into logical topics, and creating various types of quizzes for different types of assessments were done in an open working session, during the second day. The better part of day three was spent on hands-on authoring of STACK questions and identifying other textbook questions that can be added to create a bank of questions for various uses. More hands-on activities like exporting questions from other courses followed during the fourth day of the workshop. Idrissa Said, from University of Dar es Salaam, gave a presentation on various step-by-step working questions he has been using to teach mathematics. He offered to provide two of the courses he created, Numerical Analysis, Calculus of One Variable and Differential Equations for Non-Majors, to be added to the pool of courses participants can borrow resources from. Juma, A Master\u2019s student at Maseno who did a study on STACK, also gave a brief presentation on how learners have been engaging with STACK at Maseno, taking a case study of Complex Analysis 1 courses, a third-year course for all mathematics students. The last day of the workshop was mainly an open working session with Q&A from the newly recruited AMI interns, and lecturers who were working on their courses in preparation for delivery. Execution Copies of the courses developed by Maseno University were created in the IDEMS moodle site. Participants were asked to select course(s) that they would like to develop in readiness for teaching in September 2022 or January 2023 semester. The Courses selected by participants were then created under the category of their university on the IDEMS Moodle site. Participants were given managerial rights in their courses with a short training on course management in Moodle, STACK question architecture and importing questions from other courses from the list of courses they were enrolled in (to which we gave read-only access to everyone). Below is a list of courses selected by lecturers from universities that attended the workshop. These courses are what they selected to work on with readily available resources and support when it comes to implementing STACK. University Course Maseno University Descriptive statistics Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST) Linear Algebra, Calculus 1,Calculus 2, Complex Analysis 1, Complex Analysis 2, Vector Analysis Strathmore University Linear Algebra, Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Basic Mathematics, Measure Theory Kaimosi Friends University College (KAFUCO) Linear Algebra, Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Measure Theory University of Kabianga Descriptive Statistics Turkana University College Basic Mathematics Alupe University College Vector Analysis, Descriptive Statistics The University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) Linear Algebra, Calculus 1, Calculus 2 Bahir Dar University (Ethiopia) Basic Mathematics Kisii University Calculus 2 Kibabii University Complex Analysis 1 Rongo University Measure Theory Feedback from Participants The five-day event was interactive, with participants sharing experiences and reflections on what areas they'd like to spend more time on during the following day. We were able to gather the following feedback from the daily reflections, which helped direct the agenda and objectives of that session based on participant requests. It was clear to all facilitators in the workshop that after the second day, lecturers desired to learn more about authoring STACK questions. This was not the main objective of the workshop during the initial planning, but we had to adjust and give a step-by-step guide on authoring STACK questions on the third day. Authoring STACK questions was well received by participants, who got excited the entire session from conceptualization of textbook questions and taking it to STACK. This session brought together lecturers and interns, the recent graduates who\u2019ll form the task force that will provide technical support to lecturers who\u2019ll be using STACK by creating more STACK resources. At the end of the workshop, lecturers from Rongo, Kiisi, KAFUCO, Kabiang\u2019a, Turkana, Alupe and Kibabii pointed out that that their universities did not have the Moodle online Learner Management System (LMS). IDEMS promised to step in and allow them to run the courses on their servers, the same way it has been supporting University of Dar es Salaam and Maseno when it began using STACK in 2019. Representatives from Masinde Muliro University mentioned that after the last upgrade of their Moodle LMS, the STACK plugin was not configured. They were asked to write to IDEMS for support and in the meantime to also run their courses on the IDEMS servers. Some lecturers identified that authoring STACK questions is time-consuming, requires a little bit of ICT experience and hard work. This sparked a discussion on the various available resources IDEMS and INNODEMS as collaboratively making to assist in ensuring such challenges are taken care of. This was also discussed, although as an inhouse agenda by INNODEMS to recruit recent graduates, who\u2019ll be trained on authoring of STACK question types to provide more man power that can support lecturers using STACK. Idrissa Said, a lecturer from the University of Dar es Salaam shared sample step-by-step randomized STACK question types he is using in teaching mathematics in an engineering course. This sparked positive reviews from participants on the potential of STACK in teaching, learning and assessment of STEM. Challenges in the workshop One of the main challenges we had was that courses for the 2022/2023 academic year had not been allocated to lecturers in most universities. Hence lecturers were not certain that they would teach the course they were developing. Lecturers however expressed optimism that either they could persuade their heads of departments to assign them the courses they were creating, or that they could, if given a new course, develop it with the help of IDEMS and INNODEMS in time for the start of classes. Another challenge was that we could not accept all applications (more than 60) due to limited funding and not having enough facilitators to cater for the large group. We however felt that the number we had (49) was optimal for the available funding and manageable for the 8 facilitators in the workshop. Inadequate equipment was also a major challenge. There were some participants who would have liked the workshop to be online. This is because of finances on their part, teaching and departmental duties at their institutions and flexibility offered by online workshops. We however did not have equipment that would have made giving an online workshop possible. Giving an online workshop would have forced us to reformulate our objectives for the workshop because support would be less efficient. We also believed that personal interactions with other participants, facilitators and interns was important in creating a STACK community. This is one challenge we would like to address in the coming years and with adequate funding. Inadequate institutional support remains a challenge at Maseno. Even though the workshop had full blessings and support of the Vice Chancellor, getting lecturers in the School of Mathematics to commit to using STACK for online assessment remains a challenge. It would be more efficient if more lecturers are involved through discussions on what kind of support they need to allow them to integrate online assessment with STACK seamlessly. Enablers One of the main collaborators of the 2022 Maseno STACK workshop was IDEMS International. Apart from providing financial backing, they paid for travel of Georg Osang (one of their employees) to Maseno to help facilitate the workshop as well as train interns on authoring of STACK questions. IDEMS International also provided direct support in the planning and execution of the workshop as well as coordinating travel for international participants. The university of Geneva through a research fund for Danilo Lewanski and his research partners was also a key funder for the workshop. Indeed, we were able to increase participation from an initial estimate of 20 to 50 largely because of the funding from the University of Geneva. INNODEMS recruited 4 graduate students from Maseno as prospective interns who are currently undergoing training on authoring STACK question types and quality control of the existing materials, with the help of IDEMS International. With the support of the African Maths Initiative, this is done with the aim of providing support to various lecturers to integrate STACK in their courses. Furthermore, INNODEMS was also a key supporter in terms of handling finances, providing logistics and Internet supply for the entire week. Aside from the INNODEMS interns who participated in the workshop, there were other employees who attended the workshop and helped in coordinating events and logistics. Lastly Maseno University was integral in providing support in the even, through the Vice Chancellor Prof. Nyabundi, who personally opened the event on day one and pledged to give full support of any kind to see it a success in future. In his speech, the Vice Chancellor expressed optimism that the myth mathematics is a difficult subject could be demystified through improvements in the teaching and learning. The Vice Chancellor also expressed his desire to see more STACK workshops held at Maseno University. What Next? We have learned some valuable lessons in organizing and giving this workshop. One of the main lessons learned is that planning has to start early in order to attract international participation and facilitation. We missed out on having a number of international facilitators because the planning of the workshop was not concretized early enough. Applications for funding have to be made in a timely manner, and even prior to setting workshop structures in place, there must be clear details on available finances and expected expenditures. This year's workshop was largely successful due to funding from IDEMS and the University of Geneva. Application for the funding was not made in a timely manner which almost derailed the organization of the workshop. Management of funding was another important lesson. We managed to have a workshop with 49 participants from three different countries on a budget of less than 10,000USD. Of the participants, only two paid the application fee of less than 200USD, while most participants paid for their own travel and accommodation. With this hard lesson learned, we have started organizing the 2023 workshops with tentative venues being Masinde Muliro University Kenya, Bahir Dar university Ethiopia and the university of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. There is even a discussion of having three local and more impactful workshops in the three countries.

However, after the 2022 workshop held at Maseno, there have been plans in using STACK at Bahir Dar for formative assessment as from September 2022. Apart from Maseno University, the University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), has also successfully used STACK in formative and summative continuous assessment since the 2019 workshop in three of its courses, Numerical Analysis, Calculus of One Variable and Differential Equations for Non-Majors. Some Kenyan universities have been inconsistent with using STACK in assessment, which is what this 2022 workshop hoped to address. In Uganda and Rwanda, there has been no feedback on the use of STACK. STACK resources developed at Maseno were uploaded in the IDEMS server to allow participants in the workshop to access them. Calculus I & Calculus II Descriptive Statistics Basic Mathematics Vector Analysis Complex Analysis 1 & Complex Analysis II Measure Theory Linear Algebra 1 Resources in these courses are also being reviewed to improve the quality of feedback provided to students for the next semester, which begins in September 2022. Probability Theory and Foundations of Pure Mathematics are two more courses under development.

Furthermore, to also inform participants on the possibility of IDEMS, INNODEMS, and AMI assistance, as implementing partners when it comes to supporting the use of STACK and the creation of resources. Give lecturers practical experience with STACK and Moodle course organization through working on a course they intend to teach in the coming academic year, most likely to commence on the September of 2022. Create a community of STACK users in Kenya and East Africa as a whole, who will work together on improving undergraduate mathematics education through open initiatives, creating new materials and sharing the available resources, besides networking.","title":"Objectives of the Workshop"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2022/MasenoWorkshop/#summary-of-the-workshop-program","text":"This section summarizes the daily events that took place as part of the workshop from 4th to 8th July, 2022. On the first day, a presentation on the features of STACK and its usage at Maseno University was done by Dr. Isaac Owino (The Chair of the Math Department). Lecturers in the workshop were then allowed to peruse the available courses created by Maseno and IDEMS international, identify a course they\u2019d be working on to ready it for delivery in their various institutions, and form collaborative groups during the workshop. Copies of the courses were then created and participants enrolled in readiness for the next agenda, customizing the existing content to suit individual needs. Organizing content in the course, structuring resources into logical topics, and creating various types of quizzes for different types of assessments were done in an open working session, during the second day. The better part of day three was spent on hands-on authoring of STACK questions and identifying other textbook questions that can be added to create a bank of questions for various uses. More hands-on activities like exporting questions from other courses followed during the fourth day of the workshop. Idrissa Said, from University of Dar es Salaam, gave a presentation on various step-by-step working questions he has been using to teach mathematics. He offered to provide two of the courses he created, Numerical Analysis, Calculus of One Variable and Differential Equations for Non-Majors, to be added to the pool of courses participants can borrow resources from. Juma, A Master\u2019s student at Maseno who did a study on STACK, also gave a brief presentation on how learners have been engaging with STACK at Maseno, taking a case study of Complex Analysis 1 courses, a third-year course for all mathematics students. The last day of the workshop was mainly an open working session with Q&A from the newly recruited AMI interns, and lecturers who were working on their courses in preparation for delivery.","title":"Summary of the Workshop Program"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2022/MasenoWorkshop/#execution","text":"Copies of the courses developed by Maseno University were created in the IDEMS moodle site.

We were able to gather the following feedback from the daily reflections, which helped direct the agenda and objectives of that session based on participant requests. It was clear to all facilitators in the workshop that after the second day, lecturers desired to learn more about authoring STACK questions. This was not the main objective of the workshop during the initial planning, but we had to adjust and give a step-by-step guide on authoring STACK questions on the third day. Authoring STACK questions was well received by participants, who got excited the entire session from conceptualization of textbook questions and taking it to STACK. This session brought together lecturers and interns, the recent graduates who\u2019ll form the task force that will provide technical support to lecturers who\u2019ll be using STACK by creating more STACK resources. At the end of the workshop, lecturers from Rongo, Kiisi, KAFUCO, Kabiang\u2019a, Turkana, Alupe and Kibabii pointed out that that their universities did not have the Moodle online Learner Management System (LMS). IDEMS promised to step in and allow them to run the courses on their servers, the same way it has been supporting University of Dar es Salaam and Maseno when it began using STACK in 2019. Representatives from Masinde Muliro University mentioned that after the last upgrade of their Moodle LMS, the STACK plugin was not configured. They were asked to write to IDEMS for support and in the meantime to also run their courses on the IDEMS servers. Some lecturers identified that authoring STACK questions is time-consuming, requires a little bit of ICT experience and hard work. This sparked a discussion on the various available resources IDEMS and INNODEMS as collaboratively making to assist in ensuring such challenges are taken care of. This was also discussed, although as an inhouse agenda by INNODEMS to recruit recent graduates, who\u2019ll be trained on authoring of STACK question types to provide more man power that can support lecturers using STACK. Idrissa Said, a lecturer from the University of Dar es Salaam shared sample step-by-step randomized STACK question types he is using in teaching mathematics in an engineering course. This sparked positive reviews from participants on the potential of STACK in teaching, learning and assessment of STEM.","title":"Feedback from Participants"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2022/MasenoWorkshop/#challenges-in-the-workshop","text":"One of the main challenges we had was that courses for the 2022/2023 academic year had not been allocated to lecturers in most universities. Hence lecturers were not certain that they would teach the course they were developing. Lecturers however expressed optimism that either they could persuade their heads of departments to assign them the courses they were creating, or that they could, if given a new course, develop it with the help of IDEMS and INNODEMS in time for the start of classes. Another challenge was that we could not accept all applications (more than 60) due to limited funding and not having enough facilitators to cater for the large group. We however felt that the number we had (49) was optimal for the available funding and manageable for the 8 facilitators in the workshop. Inadequate equipment was also a major challenge. There were some participants who would have liked the workshop to be online. This is because of finances on their part, teaching and departmental duties at their institutions and flexibility offered by online workshops. We however did not have equipment that would have made giving an online workshop possible. Giving an online workshop would have forced us to reformulate our objectives for the workshop because support would be less efficient. We also believed that personal interactions with other participants, facilitators and interns was important in creating a STACK community. This is one challenge we would like to address in the coming years and with adequate funding. Inadequate institutional support remains a challenge at Maseno. Even though the workshop had full blessings and support of the Vice Chancellor, getting lecturers in the School of Mathematics to commit to using STACK for online assessment remains a challenge. It would be more efficient if more lecturers are involved through discussions on what kind of support they need to allow them to integrate online assessment with STACK seamlessly.","title":"Challenges in the workshop"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2022/MasenoWorkshop/#enablers","text":"One of the main collaborators of the 2022 Maseno STACK workshop was IDEMS International. Apart from providing financial backing, they paid for travel of Georg Osang (one of their employees) to Maseno to help facilitate the workshop as well as train interns on authoring of STACK questions. IDEMS International also provided direct support in the planning and execution of the workshop as well as coordinating travel for international participants. The university of Geneva through a research fund for Danilo Lewanski and his research partners was also a key funder for the workshop. Indeed, we were able to increase participation from an initial estimate of 20 to 50 largely because of the funding from the University of Geneva. INNODEMS recruited 4 graduate students from Maseno as prospective interns who are currently undergoing training on authoring STACK question types and quality control of the existing materials, with the help of IDEMS International. With the support of the African Maths Initiative, this is done with the aim of providing support to various lecturers to integrate STACK in their courses. Furthermore, INNODEMS was also a key supporter in terms of handling finances, providing logistics and Internet supply for the entire week. Aside from the INNODEMS interns who participated in the workshop, there were other employees who attended the workshop and helped in coordinating events and logistics. Lastly Maseno University was integral in providing support in the even, through the Vice Chancellor Prof. Nyabundi, who personally opened the event on day one and pledged to give full support of any kind to see it a success in future. In his speech, the Vice Chancellor expressed optimism that the myth mathematics is a difficult subject could be demystified through improvements in the teaching and learning. The Vice Chancellor also expressed his desire to see more STACK workshops held at Maseno University.","title":"Enablers"},{"location":"CaseStudies/2022/MasenoWorkshop/#what-next","text":"We have learned some valuable lessons in organizing and giving this workshop. One of the main lessons learned is that planning has to start early in order to attract international participation and facilitation. We missed out on having a number of international facilitators because the planning of the workshop was not concretized early enough. Applications for funding have to be made in a timely manner, and even prior to setting workshop structures in place, there must be clear details on available finances and expected expenditures. This year's workshop was largely successful due to funding from IDEMS and the University of Geneva. Application for the funding was not made in a timely manner which almost derailed the organization of the workshop. Management of funding was another important lesson. We managed to have a workshop with 49 participants from three different countries on a budget of less than 10,000USD. Of the participants, only two paid the application fee of less than 200USD, while most participants paid for their own travel and accommodation. With this hard lesson learned, we have started organizing the 2023 workshops with tentative venues being Masinde Muliro University Kenya, Bahir Dar university Ethiopia and the university of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. There is even a discussion of having three local and more impactful workshops in the three countries.

Eichhorn and Andreas Helfrich-Schkarbanenko Abstract We present a method to evaluate fill-in-the-blank student answers in STACK using a string metric. To increase the quality of the evaluation, we use two lists: allowlist and denylist instead of a single teacher's answer. We also show a STACK question equipped with a string metric, by evaluating its use in mathematics courses. String similarity The fill-in-the-blank questions are important from a didactic point of view. But they can be hardly implemented, since typing and spelling errors, synonyms and geuine alternatives have to be taken into account when evaluating the students' answers. To automatically mark fill-in-the-blank questions we used one of the string metrics for measuring the distance between two strings: the Damerau-Levenshtein distance [1, 2], which plays an important role in natural language processing. Informally, this distance is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertion, deletion, substitution, transition) required to change one string sequence into the other. Note that this distance is a metric in mathematical sense, in particular it satisfies the triangle inequality. This enables a suitable string evaluation. To increase the quality of the assessment, we extended the basic metric function by the adding the components: allowlist and denylist. To have a relative measure of the difference between two strings, we convert the distance to similarity . Applying the similarity on allowlist and denylist we define an acceptance domain for the students' answers. Here we need an empirically determined threshold parameter. Note that the presented method is, strictly speaking, not only based on the strings, but also on semantics, because by introducing the denylist and allowlist respectively, a (trivial) semantic graph consisting of two clusters is set up. For the sake of simplicity, the evaluation of a student's answer does not take place by means of a semantic distance, but using the string distance to the respective cluster as a whole (single linkage, minimum distance, nearest neighbour, see for example [3]). The Mathematics If the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between strings a and b is \\mathbf{d}(a,b) \\in [0,\\max\\{ |a|, |b| \\}] then the similarity is defined as \\mathbf{s}(a,b) := 1- \\frac{\\mathbf{d}(a,b)}{\\max\\{ |a|, |b| \\}} Given lists \\mbox{allowlist} = \\{ TA_1, TA_1, TA_1, \\cdots \\} \\mbox{denylist} = \\{ WA_1, WA_1, WA_1, \\cdots \\} then \\mathbf{s}(a,\\mbox{list}) := \\max_{k=1,\\cdots, K} \\mathbf{s}(a,b_k) We then have an acceptance domain in which \\left( \\mathbf{s}(a,\\mbox{allowlist}) > \\mathbf{s}(a,\\mbox{denylist}) \\right) \\wedge \\left( \\mathbf{s}(a,\\mbox{allowlist}) > \\theta \\right) for some chosen similarity tollerance \\theta . Here are some examples using the strings \"Circle\", \"Triangle\" and \"Rectangle\", together with their Damerau-Levenshtein distance / similarity. Figure: illustrating the Damerau-Levenshtein distance / similarity of example stings. Experiments We asked students for a suitable solution method by using a fill-in-the-blank question when given a differential equation, see subtask a). This task was used in the winter semester 2021/22 as part of a mini-test for the lecture Mathematics 2. It was completed by 53 students and all student answers were scored error-free. Figure: An example question with a string input. We implemented a string metric directly in the computer algebra system MAXIMA and placed the corresponding function in the Question Variables field of the STACK question concerned. The corresponding XML file can be downloaded from this link (June 2022). In the bottom figure we see 18 different student answers (in German) which are positioned in a coordinate system according to both similarities and are classified without errors. The radii of the disks represent the number of equal student answers. In total, this task was processed 263 times. The acceptance domain for correct answers is white-marked. Figure: Results of running the sample task. Note that for this STACK question and the given allowlist resp. denylist, only the consideration of the allowlist similarity would be sufficient for the evaluation. However, there are situations where the denylist is necessary.

Bahir Dar University (BDU) is rising to these challenges by seizing the opportunity for change to improve the provision of student centred learning and support for maths and related courses. The BDU Mathematics Department recognises the leadership role it has, specifically as a role model for other Ethiopian Universities. In March 2023 the BDU Mathematics Department brought together 49 people from 12 Ethiopian universities to identify priority challenges and actions as foundations for an ambitious, yet achievable, approach to improved quality, consistency and results in mathematics education at this crucial moment in time. This event was co-facilitated by 3 IDEMS International Staff and a Kenyan Educational Innovator who brought in STACK expertise at BDU\u2019s request as this was an open source tool they had identified which could add value to their teaching and learning. This case-study outlines 3 of 15 reported outcomes of the event, described in detail in a draft report . These three highlighted opportunities stand out because of their urgency with all three needing immediate action. Two of the three correspond to supporting students in preparation for unprecedented exams that will take place within the next 4 months. After August, this moment in time will have passed. Supporting student success at this crucial time has institutional and national ramifications. Figure 2: Discussion and practical workshop sessions 1. Remedial learning support by July 2023 Challenge In 2023 only 3% of school leavers achieved passing grades , leaving thousands without the university place they applied for . All Ethiopian universities have been mandated by the Ministry of Education to provide remedial courses for prospective students to enable them to start their degrees. Delivery for these courses started in early April and is expected to run for 16 weeks, followed by an exam. There is a huge need and potential to significantly alleviate the expanded staff workload imposed by remedial courses and support student learning through STACK. IDEMS and staff at BDU are co-designing a STACK remedial course in maths, in which any university can enrol their students. The course will cover all topics in the remedial course, and provide formative assessment to allow students to gain from personalised feedback and consolidate mastery through repeated attempts of randomly generated versions of each question. Action: Rapid response teaching and learning support for maths The STACK course is in development and each new topic will be released on a weekly basis. If the full course is implemented, students nationally will gain targeted learning and support for remedial maths, increasing the chance of students securing their place at university as planned. Intended outputs and impacts: A single online course with mastery questions for each topic in the curriculum (13 areas of maths in total). Topics available from April 2023 to BDU (and up to 100,000 students at other universities nationally adopting the system). Remove mathematics as a barrier for remedial student success. The shortfall in new students in 2023 could be minimised, reducing the consequent lack of new future graduates as this year\u2019s crisis works through progression rates. 2. National Exit Exam support by June 2023 Challenge The Ethiopian school exit exam is at the forefront of Ethiopian Universities minds at the moment. An institution's future desirability is will be strongly linked to their current students' performance. In Mathematics such an assessment is almost unprecedented and universities are looking to each other for support to ensure their students are prepared. Action: online preparation for the first exit exams in 2023 A majority of the mathematics curricula to be tested in exit exams is already available as digital questions from institutions using STACK in Kenya and Tanzania. Importing these existing questions would populate 50-75% of the exit exam blueprints for maths in Ethiopia, reducing development time and costs, and increasing the readiness of universities for exit exams in June 2023. This would serve all BSc/BEd maths students nationally, plus a greater number of others with a maths component to their degree , e.g. accounting, engineering, statistics, data science. The same system would also enable new material for preparation and revision for the exit exams to be re-used among Ethiopian universities, sharing the development resources required and increasing the speed at which outstanding curriculum gaps could be collectively filled. By continuing to develop exit exam revision content, 100% of the blueprint would be available for online preparation in time for the 2024 round of exams. Intended outputs and impacts: Most of the current exit exam blueprints for maths would be available to support students via STACK in May-June 2023. A set of probable exam style questions for practice tests covering the whole blueprint in May-June 2023. All of the current exit exam blueprints for maths would be available to support students via STACK by June 2024. 3. Maths for Natural & Social Sciences by September 2023 Challenge Maths for Natural/Social Sciences is a core course for all university degree programmes in Ethiopia. Nationally, a significant challenge is for Maths departments to coordinate the teaching and learning of thousands of students, with varying levels of interest and enthusiasm, taking this foundational maths course. Action: Make Maths for Natural/Social Sciences into critical building blocks for engagement and achievement for all first year students across disciplines STACK supports both lecturers and learners simultaneously: By automating regular assessment with automated grading, personalised student feedback and support, lecturers\u2019 role can focus on motivating students and building the relevance of the material to students' respective interests. By giving immediate tailored learning feedback on demand, students gain control over how, when and where they engage in learning. This formative assessment approach has been successful at engaging students in other contexts and could reposition first year courses as an engaging foundation for higher education rather than an unwelcome barrier to it. Intended outputs and impacts: STACK pilot at BDU starting in April 2023 with up to 1500 students. STACK system available to all undergraduate students nationwide from September 2023. An additional opportunity: Ethiopian textbooks for Secondary School Mathematics During the workshop IDEMS staff had the opportunity to interact with a number of members of the BDU Mathematics department who were commissioned by the Ethiopian Ministry of Education to write textbooks for secondary school mathematics. For various circumstances, the decision was made to share these textbooks in electronic format. As such, the textbook authors who attended the workshop were interested in the idea of making the textbooks interactive by integrating STACK questions. An agreement was reached to build a prototype of an interactive textbook for two topics which would demonstrate how students can practice and get relevant feedback on their attempts at questions. IDEMS are working with one of the textbook authors on creating a prototype for the topics of Equations and Vectors which they intend to present within BDU and potentially to the Ministry as an alternative delivery mechanism.

There is a huge need and potential to significantly alleviate the expanded staff workload imposed by remedial courses and support student learning through STACK. IDEMS and staff at BDU are co-designing a STACK remedial course in maths, in which any university can enrol their students.

Figure 1: Typical exam question (transl: Determine the following integral) The method needed to solve this question is integration using partial fractions and used to be taught intensively in high school. In most high schools throughout Switzerland this is no longer the case. Of course one could discuss whether it is still necessary, in view of technology, to teach this method, but we do not want to go into this discussion here. We simply assume for the time being that this is still a skill that we want to test in an exam. In the past we tried two ways of teaching this in a classical lecture. One way was to develop the theory behind it; this was very time consuming and did not really interest most of the students as all they needed in the end was the recipe how to do it. Alternatively we simply gave them the algorithm and did some examples with them in class. This was not satisfying either, as the anti-derivatives that showed up there were not intuitive and maths seemed to have become a tool box (or even black box?) that no one understands, but one just applies, strongly contradicting our beliefs as educators. In this Case Study we will introduce a more satisfying solution for us to teach this topic, both for students and for lecturers, using STACK. A Moodle Quiz We designed a Moodle Quiz which gives a step by step introduction to the method of using partial fractions to integrate rational functions. Figure 2: Navigation through Moodle quiz The quiz assumes very little prior knowledge. Students only need to know the factor and sum rules for integration and the following anti-derivative \\int \\frac{1}{x}\\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\ln|x| + c. \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad(1) Students who want to discover this method all by themselves can try to do so, but they will need to invest a fair amount of time (or perhaps refresh their high school knowledge). For others we provide extensive hints and solutions. Whatever the students decide to do, they will be guided in a natural way to the more complicated anti-derivatives and thereby develop a deeper understanding of the method and the results. As you can see in figure 2, the quiz is divided into many small sections, each focusing on one step at a time. Figure 3 shows the first section which deals with integrating very simple fractions. All a student needs to know and apply is the basic anti-derivative (1). The question on the left should be straightforward, but for the question on the right a simple substitution is required. If the student does not remember how to do this, the two offered hints should help. We used the setup for hints programmed by Michael Kallweit, see [1]. These hints are not visible upon first opening the question, but can be opened by clicking on a button. Figure 3: Two easy introductory questions The next series of questions, shown in figure 4, demonstrates the general principle of the quiz. After starting with an easy example the students are led to more general situations. They can always use hints when it is unclear why one question should be seen as a generalisation of a previous one. If the hints do not suffice, the student can also ask for a worked solution and then try the question again. We use gently randomised numbers for new attempts such that some work is required when trying again. Figure 4: Series of questions Execution These STACK questions are part of our so-called Integral Trainer (see [2]). This tool is designed for students to practice and improve their integration skills. The project was conceptualised by two experienced maths lecturers and programmed mainly by our STACK developer. The quiz about rational functions consists of 22 questions and covers rational functions with general quadratic denominator or with cubic denominators with real roots, see figure 5. Figure 5: Final question None of the questions use the Int answer test, but rather the AlgEquiv answer test. The main reason for this is the constant of integration. Using the latter test the teacher can decide whether or not to give partial credit if only the constant of integration is missing. Another delicate situation arises when computing integrals of the form \\displaystyle \\int \\frac{2x+p}{x^2+px+q}\\, \\mathrm{d}x, for which the discriminant of the de-nominator is \\Delta = p^2-4q \\neq 0, see figure 6. \\( \\Delta < 0 \\) \\( \\Delta > 0 \\) Figure 6: Question 14 Is the answer \\ln(x^2+px+q)+c or \\ln(\\left|x^2+px+q\\right|)+c ? Of course it depends on the discriminant. If \\Delta < 0 , then both answers should be interpreted as correct, but if \\Delta > 0 , then the absolute value is mandatory. Thus we use a certain trick to distinguish between these situations. The idea is to determine a point that indicates whether the absolute value is needed or not. In this case we considered the y -coordinate of the vertex of the parabola associated to the student's answer. Then we calculated its logarithm. If this number has imaginary part equal to zero, then the absolute value is not needed, otherwise it is mandatory. Unfortunately, the Int answer test did not completely meet our needs. The example above was one of the questions which ignited a technical discussion with Chris Sangwin about the use and limitations of the Int answer test. We hope that this will lead to improvements and calibrations in its design. For more information on how the Int answer test works, we refer to the STACK documentation [3]. Results This quiz was so far used in two ways: One lecturer instructed the students to solve the first part of the quiz before coming to class (as with a Flipped Classroom) and then only showed some harder examples in class. Another lecturer explained the method in a traditional style and used the quiz as extra practice material. Both sets of data have not been evaluated yet, nor the effect of the quiz on the exam. What's next? As a next step we will (certainly) try to evaluate both the data collected in our quiz and the exam results. After we have analysed those, further steps will hopefully become clear.

The conference aims to enable African educators with experience on STACK to define a roadmap for transformation of African maths education. Since 2019, African universities started incorporating STACK assessments to their undergraduate courses, particularly to deal with issues of large class sizes (some classes are over 1,200 students) with a single lecturer and no additional human resources. A concerted effort was started by groups of universities, with the support of IDEMS International , to promote STACK in the region through open resources and question banks, which are slowly spreading throughout the continent, with the objective of full curriculum coverage. The conference will provide a platform for lecturers to present their experiences incorporating STACK to undergraduate courses, their methodologies and impact found. Key stakeholders will have an opportunity to extend their collaboration and accelerate the integration of STACK. The conference will include a 2-day STACK workshop, 2 days of paper and poster presentations, and a final day roundtable discussion with key stakeholders or an additional workshop.

Between Dec 2019 and Dec 2022, the 3 pandemic years, the need to create more online resourses expanded significantly and many universities created staff posts for people whose main role is to author STACK questions. These posts also support a large and growing community of STACK users in their institutions. The Network will bring these people together and contribute to the knowledge sharing among them. The 1st STACK Network meeting took place on the 9th of December 2022 in the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. The purpose of the meeting was to bring together the people of the Network and set some initial goals for the Network. The topics that were discussed during the meeting can be divided into two categories: (i) how the members can contribute to the STACK project and (ii) how the Network will support its members. How the Network will support its members Using STACK to automate mathematics and STEM assessments requires specialist skills, and the people who do this job typically work in isolation in their institutions. In many cases there is only one person in the department/university doing this job, so they don't have much local help for STACK-related issues that they may encounter. The Network will help the STACK professionals to solve various authoring difficulties and also make it easier to share existing questions/quizzes amongst themselves. Mathematics curriculum, especially topics like algebra, calculus, or differential equations, are very similar around the globe, so many existing STACK questions can be easily shared and reused with minor edits. Example questions can help a question author get started in a new topic area. While some colleagues are reluctant to freely post whole courses, most are very willing to share examples especially with colleagues with whom they already have a professional relationship. The Network can provide training to colleagues who are new to STACK and support them with authoring, testing and maintaining their questions. Members of the Network can also support the development of the pedagogy associated with using STACK questions effectively. Another goal of the Network is to provide visibility to this specialist, technical work, so that the work of the STACK professionals will acquire better recognition. Most of the content created by the STACK professionals is behind passwords, and intellectual property belongs to institutions rather than individuals, so the authors of the questions don't have a long-term track record of their work. Not all professionals contribute towards research, they don't necessarily publish papers, so all this work can easily be unnoticed. How the members will contribute to the STACK project The members of the Network are highly encouraged to contribute by improving the documentation, with a particular focus on sharing expertise and \"know-how\" of system features for specific subjects. Other ways that the members can contribute are: Sharing and organising demo questions Sharing sample questions and question banks Creating templates questions Testing and maintaining questions Helping to set priorities for developing the STACK system, with their views having stronger weight than typical end-users Since STACK has become widely used in many countries the Network can help with translating the system and various sample materials to different languages. Members can certainly help translators understand how the various language strings are used within the software, something not immediately obvious to some translators.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss that issues that raised during the recent International meeting of the STACK Community (April 2023). It was also a good opportunity to welcome new members. Topics Discussed: New STACK Release: Chris presented the new STACK release, STACK 4.4.3, and demonstrated its new features. The key features of this release included improved cleaning of Unicode from students' input strings, descriptions to the question (castext), the PRT nodes, and the question tests. Additionally, an input extra option validator was introduced to allow user-defined validation functions. A new reveal block in questions was also added. It was emphasized that users should check their existing questions after updating to STACK 4.4.3, especially in relation to the changes in JSX graphs. Further details about the new features can be found in the documentation provided at https://docs.stack-assessment.org/en/Developer/Development_history/ . Bulk Testing for STACK Update: It was recommended that everyone who is updating to the new STACK version should perform bulk testing of their questions. However, not everyone has admin privileges on their local servers, making it necessary to seek assistance from the local IT team. To support colleagues who lacked admin privileges, Maciej volunteered to write guidelines for testing quizzes, which will be shared with the team. Note, for moodle users there is a capability qtype/stack:usediagnostictools . If you don't have admin rights at your university you can make a case for a group of STACK users to be granted this capability, which is needed for the bulk test, and other STACK maintenance functions. API, Managing Questions Outside Moodle: The meeting included a discussion on exploring API options for managing questions outside Moodle. While the topic proved to be highly technical, it generated interest among some participants. Santiago expressed willingness to assist in putting together a funding application if there is genuine interest from the team. It was proposed to organize a dedicated meeting specifically focused on this topic to ensure a detailed discussion with interested members. Update on 2023-07-07: Tim and Andreas made a start with this new Moodle tool: https://github.com/maths/moodle-qbank_importasversion which allows you to import a question from a Moodle XML file as a new version of an existing question. Github training All of the STACK sourcecode, documentation and the community website can be found in the Github repository https://github.com/maths . However, since not everyone is familiar with using Github, this can serve as a barrier for contributing to the documentation. To address this issue, we decided to organize a Github training. The aim of this training is to assist people in becoming more familiar with Github and to boost their confidence in contributing to the STACK website https://stack-assessment.org/ (Github repository https://github.com/maths/stack-web ) by adding case studies, advertising events, and updating documents. Funding Opportunities, Grant Opportunities: The possibility of securing funding for professional networks was discussed. A stream was created in Zulipchat to coordinate efforts in writing grant applications. Communications: Zulipchat was identified as the preferred communication platform for the organization, providing a centralized space for discussions and issue reporting. Github was emphasized as the primary platform for reporting code-related issues. https://stack-assessment.zulipchat.com/ Next Meetings: Despite the approaching summer season, it was suggested to schedule another meeting in July and another in early September. This would ensure continued progress and provide opportunities for further discussions and updates.

It was also a good opportunity to welcome new members.","title":"2nd STACK Network meeting report, June 2023"},{"location":"MeetingReports/2023-06-09-NetworkReport/#topics-discussed","text":"New STACK Release: Chris presented the new STACK release, STACK 4.4.3, and demonstrated its new features. The key features of this release included improved cleaning of Unicode from students' input strings, descriptions to the question (castext), the PRT nodes, and the question tests. Additionally, an input extra option validator was introduced to allow user-defined validation functions. A new reveal block in questions was also added. It was emphasized that users should check their existing questions after updating to STACK 4.4.3, especially in relation to the changes in JSX graphs. Further details about the new features can be found in the documentation provided at https://docs.stack-assessment.org/en/Developer/Development_history/ . Bulk Testing for STACK Update: It was recommended that everyone who is updating to the new STACK version should perform bulk testing of their questions. However, not everyone has admin privileges on their local servers, making it necessary to seek assistance from the local IT team. To support colleagues who lacked admin privileges, Maciej volunteered to write guidelines for testing quizzes, which will be shared with the team. Note, for moodle users there is a capability qtype/stack:usediagnostictools . If you don't have admin rights at your university you can make a case for a group of STACK users to be granted this capability, which is needed for the bulk test, and other STACK maintenance functions. API, Managing Questions Outside Moodle: The meeting included a discussion on exploring API options for managing questions outside Moodle. While the topic proved to be highly technical, it generated interest among some participants. Santiago expressed willingness to assist in putting together a funding application if there is genuine interest from the team. It was proposed to organize a dedicated meeting specifically focused on this topic to ensure a detailed discussion with interested members. Update on 2023-07-07: Tim and Andreas made a start with this new Moodle tool: https://github.com/maths/moodle-qbank_importasversion which allows you to import a question from a Moodle XML file as a new version of an existing question. Github training All of the STACK sourcecode, documentation and the community website can be found in the Github repository https://github.com/maths . However, since not everyone is familiar with using Github, this can serve as a barrier for contributing to the documentation. To address this issue, we decided to organize a Github training. The aim of this training is to assist people in becoming more familiar with Github and to boost their confidence in contributing to the STACK website https://stack-assessment.org/ (Github repository https://github.com/maths/stack-web ) by adding case studies, advertising events, and updating documents. Funding Opportunities, Grant Opportunities: The possibility of securing funding for professional networks was discussed. A stream was created in Zulipchat to coordinate efforts in writing grant applications. Communications: Zulipchat was identified as the preferred communication platform for the organization, providing a centralized space for discussions and issue reporting. Github was emphasized as the primary platform for reporting code-related issues. https://stack-assessment.zulipchat.com/","title":"Topics Discussed:"},{"location":"MeetingReports/2023-06-09-NetworkReport/#next-meetings","text":"Despite the approaching summer season, it was suggested to schedule another meeting in July and another in early September.
